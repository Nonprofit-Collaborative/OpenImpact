# Loads the C-10 sample data set (200 households, 440 contacts, 25 organizations, their
# connections and affiliations, and the Giving gifts where Giving is installed) into the
# target org and waits for it to actually finish.
#
# SampleDataLoader.load() runs as a chain of queueable jobs (SampleDataLoadQueueable for
# the accounts, then SampleDataContactQueueable once per chunk of contacts), so the Apex
# call returns as soon as the first job is queued, not once loading is done. Stage one
# inserts all 200 households in a single DML, so counting households proves nothing about
# the contacts. This polls both the contact count (target read from the generated JSON)
# and AsyncApexJob, and reports success only when every contact is in and no load job is
# still queued or running. See docs/admin-guide/sample-data.md and data/sample/README.md.
#
# Safe to call before scripts/org/load-sample-data.apex exists; it just prints a note
# and exits successfully so callers (create-scratch-org.sh) do not fail.
