#
# Creates a scratch org of the given shape, deploys Core, assigns Core's permission sets, and
# (for the platform-only shape) verifies that a Salesforce Platform license user can use every
# packaged permission set. See docs/contributor-guide/scratch-orgs.md for the full explanation.
#
# Shapes (see config/scratch-defs/):
#   platform-only     Developer edition, no Sales/Service objects available to the org's
#                      standard users. See the PLATFORM-ONLY VERIFICATION comment below for why
#                      this shape needs an extra check that the others do not.
#   sales-cloud        Enterprise edition, standard Sales Cloud objects available.
#   npsp                Enterprise edition, NPSP installed on top (scripts/org/install-npsp.sh).
#   person-accounts     Enterprise edition with Person Accounts enabled.
#   nonprofit-cloud     Enterprise edition with Person Accounts and the Nonprofit Cloud
#                      feature. Needs a Dev Hub that carries the Nonprofit Cloud entitlement:
#                      an ordinary Developer Edition Dev Hub cannot create this shape, and
#                      says so by listing the features it can grant. See
#                      docs/contributor-guide/scratch-orgs.md before using it.

# PLATFORM-ONLY VERIFICATION
#
# Scratch orgs always provision Sales Cloud objects regardless of the requested edition or
# features; there is no scratch-org setting that removes them. So the platform-only shape
# cannot be verified simply by inspecting what exists in the org. Instead we verify it two ways:
#   (a) a CI static check (scripts/ci/check-standard-objects.sh) that fails if any file under
#       packages/core (or any other non-Connect package) references a Sales/Service/Industries
#       object, so the source itself never depends on what a real Platform-only org lacks; and
#   (b) here, at org-creation time for the platform-only shape only: we create a user with the
#       "Salesforce Platform" user license and the "Standard Platform User" profile, then assign
#       every Core permission set to that user. The "Standard Platform User" profile cannot see
#       Sales/Service objects, so if any Core permission set grants access to an object that
#       license cannot see, the assignment fails loudly, which is exactly the signal we want.
