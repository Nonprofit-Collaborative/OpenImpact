# Installs NPSP and its dependency packages, in order, into the target org/alias.
#
# NPSP requires installing, in this order:
#   1. Contacts & Organizations (npe01)
#   2. Households (npo02)
#   3. Recurring Donations (npe03)
#   4. Relationships (npe4)
#   5. Affiliations (npe5)
#   6. NPSP (npsp)
#
# IDs research (2026-09-07): attempted to source current 04t package version IDs from
# https://install.salesforce.org/products/npsp and https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/NPSP/releases.
# The releases page surfaced only a beta version id for the main NPSP package (no confirmed
# GA id, and no ids at all for the five dependency packages npe01/npo02/npe03/npe4/npe5), and
# install.salesforce.org was not reachable from this environment. Per the hard rule to never
# invent package version IDs, NPSP_PACKAGE_IDS below is intentionally left empty.
#
# MANUAL STEP (until this script is updated with verified IDs):
#   Use the NPSP installer at https://install.salesforce.org/products/npsp, logged in against
#   the target scratch org, to install NPSP and its dependencies. See
#   docs/contributor-guide/scratch-orgs.md for the full walkthrough.
#
# Once verified 04t ids are available, populate NPSP_PACKAGE_IDS in the order above and this
# script will install each with:
#   sf package install --package <04t> --wait 30 --no-prompt --security-type AllUsers --target-org <alias>
