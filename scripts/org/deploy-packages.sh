#
# Deploys the packages to an org in stages, smallest blast radius first.
#
# WHY IN STAGES. The first deploy this project ever attempted sent all 982 components in one
# request and came back with UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION, zero components deployed, zero component
# errors, and a Salesforce ErrorId. A failure with no component attached tells you nothing
# about which of 982 things caused it. Deploying Core before Giving means the next such
# failure names a stage.
#
# It also matches how the packages actually depend on each other: the Rollup Builder module
# depends on Core, and Giving depends on both.
#
# WHY CORE IS SEVERAL STAGES. docs/contributor-guide/ci.md records this same failure
# hitting the undivided Core stage four times across four separate runs before 2026-09-09:
# always UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION, always zero components deployed, always zero component errors,
# always the same trailing code -315522575 behind a different leading number, which is why
# that page calls it a deterministic fault rather than a flake and says a re-run proves
# nothing. It recurred twice more on 2026-09-09, on two separate pushes to main, both times
# on the same undivided Core stage, which by then held 904 components in one request: the
# same shape as the original 982-component failure this file was written to avoid, just
# smaller.
#
# Splitting Core into three (data model, Apex, UI and permissions) followed Salesforce's own
# deploy dependency order and named a stage instead of nothing: the very next run, still on
# 2026-09-09, failed on data model alone, at 853 components. That is the load-bearing data
# point. 853 is close enough to 904 and 982 that a specific bad component stopped being the
# more likely explanation: three deploys of very different content (mostly Apex classes the
# first time, mostly custom fields the second) all failed in the same shape once they got
# into the same few-hundred-to-thousand range. That reads as a size effect, not a component
# defect, though it is still not proven, because nothing about this failure can be proven
# from the client side. It just stopped being a coin flip.
#
# So data model became three stages of its own: `balanced_split` divided
# packages/core/main/default/objects by file count into two roughly equal halves at runtime
# (a hand-written list of object names would go stale the first time someone adds one), and
# customMetadata, labels, static resources and custom permissions formed a third, smaller
# stage. That halving stopped being useful evidence on 2026-09-09: the two halves it produces
# are stable across runs (nothing but file *content* changed in between, and balanced_split
# only looks at file *counts*), and across four consecutive pushes that all fixed real
# component-level errors in "objects B" (139 files, 10 objects), that stage kept failing with
# the same zero-component UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION every single time, while "objects A" (144 files,
# 11 objects, comparable size) deployed clean every one of those four runs. Two same-sized
# groups behaving oppositely and consistently is not a size effect; it is evidence the fault
# tracks something specific to one or more objects inside "objects B".
#
# Objects now deploy one at a time, each its own stage, rather than split into another pair
# of same-content halves that would just repeat this result. That worked immediately: every
# object deployed clean, and it was Address__c's own real component errors (Street__c's
# invalid length, a text area field in a compact layout) that had been hiding behind the
# opaque failure the whole time, not the platform fault recurring on an object.
#
# With objects clear, the platform fault moved to the next stage in line: the four config
# directories (customMetadata, labels, staticresources, customPermissions), deployed together,
# hit it at 568 components. File count there is a badly misleading proxy: around 70 files
# across all four looked nothing like a risk, but `packages/core/main/default/labels/CustomLabels.labels-meta.xml`
# is one file holding 388 individual label components. Config is now three stages: custom
# metadata, labels (isolating that one file), and static resources with custom permissions
# together, since both are a handful of components on any count.
#
# Apex and UI/permissions are unchanged, because neither has failed yet and there is no
# evidence pointing at either.
#
# WHY A PAUSE BETWEEN STAGES. Custom metadata alone, split out from the rest of config,
# still hit the same zero-component UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION at 61 files, confirmed identical on a
# manual re-run (same ErrorId trailing code, same zero components, zero errors). 61 is nowhere
# near the few-hundred-to-thousand range every prior failure has carried, and this is the
# first time a stage that small has failed on its own, so size stops being a workable
# explanation for this occurrence specifically: something else has to be going on. Every stage
# in this script runs as its own blocking `sf project deploy start --wait 30` call, one after
# another, against the one persistent org, with no gap between a stage finishing and the next
# one starting. If the org's deploy engine needs a moment to settle after reporting a deploy
# Done before it can safely accept the next one, back to back calls with no pause would be
# exactly the condition to trigger that. Untested, and not the only remaining explanation, but
# cheap and non-destructive to try: every deploy_stage call now pauses for
# $STAGE_PAUSE_SECONDS after a successful deploy, before the next stage starts.
#
# WHY ASYNC WITH A STALL CHECK. From 2026-09-24 about 13:00 UTC, one stage per run on
# oi-test (a different one each time) sat as a DeployRequest in Status Pending with no
# StartDate until the blocking --wait 30 gave up, so the whole gate failed after 30 minutes.
# Cancelling such a request reports Canceled but leaves it Pending, and a fresh submission of
# the same stage deploys normally. So each stage is submitted with --async and followed with
# short report calls: a job still Pending with no start after STALL_SECONDS (300) is
# cancelled, best effort, and resubmitted once; a second stall fails the stage naming both
# job ids. A job that has started keeps the old 30 minute limit (DEPLOY_WAIT_MINUTES). Each
# report call is abandoned after REPORT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (60): one hung for 290s on 2026-09-24.
# A transient client error (fetch failed, ECONNRESET, a 5xx) on a submit or a report is
# retried, not taken as a failure: the same day one stage failed on "fetch failed" while the
# org reported that deploy Succeeded. After a submit error, the newest DeployRequest from the
# last minute is followed if there is one, so a stage is never deployed twice.
# POLL_SECONDS sets the report interval. `sf` is found on PATH, so a fake one can drive this
# logic in a test.
#
# WHAT THE STAGES COST, AND THE FAST DEFAULTS. About 36 stages, each followed by a 15 second
# pause, cost about 9 minutes of sleep per run plus the submit and poll overhead of every
# stage. The two faults that justified the split have since been explained by real defects
# (the Account to Import_Batch__c order, which the order below fixes, and the unparseable
# custom metadata of 2026-09-22). So the defaults are now the fast settings: no pause
# (STAGE_PAUSE_SECONDS=0) and every Core object in one request (DATA_MODEL_STAGES=combined),
# falling back to one object per stage only when that request fails with no component error
# (the platform's opaque UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION). The full gate at these settings took about 12
# minutes end to end on oi-test on 2026-10-13, clean. STAGE_PAUSE_SECONDS=15 and
# DATA_MODEL_STAGES=per-object bring back the old behaviour: see docs/contributor-guide/ci.md,
# "Faster deploys".
#
# Batch testing (D-141, 2026-10-28) made two more cuts that cost no coverage. Reports are polled
# every 5 seconds, not 15: a stage of a handful of components finished in a few seconds but was
# not seen as done until the first report, so every small stage cost about 17 seconds. And a
# stage that succeeded is no longer followed by a second, human-readable report call that lists
# every component (about 1 MB of log per run and one more CLI round trip per stage);
# DEPLOY_SHOW_COMPONENTS=1 brings it back. A failed stage still prints its full report.
#
# The D-141 amendment of 2026-10-28 (D-142) made three more cuts: Core's three config stages go
# in one request and every module in one request, each falling back to separate stages on the
# opaque failure only; and a package unchanged since the last successful deploy to the same org
# is not deployed again ("SKIPPING UNCHANGED PACKAGES" below; --full or DEPLOY_FULL=1 deploys
# everything). CONFIG_STAGES=separate and MODULE_STAGES=separate bring back the old stages.
#
# Usage: deploy-packages.sh <alias> [--core-only] [--full]
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every stage deployed, non-zero = the first stage that failed.

# (TabAccessScheduler) in every org, and an administrator may schedule others (Error Digest,
# Import Row Cleanup, Seasonal Addresses, Rollups), so without this every upgrade deploy over a
# set-up org without that setting failed at the first Apex stage. The refusal is not only for the
# scheduled class itself: a validation on barn-platform (2026-10-29) that sent TabAccessService
# but not TabAccessScheduler was refused on TabAccessService, a class the job uses. So a job of
# any BarnCRM class can block any Apex stage (a module's job uses Core classes). Before each Apex
# stage, every live scheduled job whose class is in any of the packages is recorded and aborted,
# and straight after the stage (deployed or not) each is scheduled again under its own name and
# cron expression, so an administrator's schedule is kept. Post-install would schedule the Tab Access Check again even if
# that restore failed; it finds the restored one by name and does not double it. A job is
# restored with its class's no-argument constructor, so one that was scheduled with arguments
# (the Rollup Builder's one-off full run, the automation pause's resume job) comes back as the
# class's default run, or, with no such constructor, is named as not scheduled again.

# SKIPPING UNCHANGED PACKAGES (D-141 amendment, 2026-10-28; D-56 allows "deploy only changed
# metadata"). A package whose source is identical to what the last successful run of this script
# put in this same org is not deployed again, except its Apex: run-org-tests.sh reads coverage
# from ApexCodeCoverageAggregate and relies on the deploy recompiling every class to clear it, so
# every package's classes and triggers deploy on every run.
#
# The record is one JSON file per org, named by the org id, in DEPLOY_STATE_DIR (default
# ~/.local/state/barncrm/deploy-state/<org id>.json): outside every repository and worktree, so
# all gate worktrees on this machine share it, and a fresh worktree does not lose it. It holds the
# org id, the git tree id of each deployed package, a fingerprint of the deploy inputs outside the
# packages (sfdx-project.json, .forceignore, scripts/org), and the id of the org's newest
# DeployRequest once the run finished. Any doubt means a full deploy:
#   - no record, an unreadable record, or one whose org id is not this org's;
#   - a different fingerprint (the stages or the project settings changed);
#   - a newer DeployRequest in the org than the one recorded: someone deployed something since,
#     from any machine or branch, so the org no longer holds what the record says;
#   - uncommitted or untracked changes under packages or the deploy inputs (the tree ids would not
#     describe what is deployed);
#   - DEPLOY_FULL=1 or --full.
# The record is deleted before the first stage and written only after every stage deployed, so a
# run that fails partway leaves none. Tree ids, not commit ids, are compared, so a commit that
# changes nothing in a package (docs, scripts/ci) does not count as a change to it.

# zero-component UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION on four consecutive pushes while the other (11 objects, 144
# files, comparable size) deployed clean every time. Same size, opposite and consistent
# outcomes: that is evidence against a size effect, not for one, so splitting into another
# same-content pair would not have told us anything the last four runs did not already show.

# Account.Created_By_Import_Batch__c references, and a persistent org hid that for weeks
# because Import_Batch__c was already there from an earlier run: the first fresh org failed on
# it (2026-09-23). The order is computed from each field's referenceTo, not written down, so an
# object added later cannot reintroduce the same failure. Ties stay alphabetical, so the order

# falling back to the three stages only on the opaque failure, as the data model does: both
# faults that justified the split were later traced to real defects. CONFIG_STAGES=separate
# brings back the three stages from the start.
#
# One stage per config directory, not one stage for all four. Every object deployed clean
# individually (the finding the per-object split above was designed to produce), so the very
# next stage in line, the four config directories deployed together, is what hit the platform
# fault this time: 568 components in one request from a directory set whose file count (about
# 70 across all four) looked nowhere near that. The gap is CustomLabels.labels-meta.xml, one
# file holding 388 individual label components; file count is a proxy for component count,
# not the same number, and a single label file is the sharpest case yet of that proxy failing.
# Splitting by directory isolates that file's stage from the other three, which are small on
# any count (customMetadata's ~60 files are ~60 components, one per record; static resources
# and custom permissions are a handful each).
