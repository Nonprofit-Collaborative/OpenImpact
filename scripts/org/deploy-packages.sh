#
# Deploys the packages to an org in stages, smallest blast radius first.
#
# WHY IN STAGES. The first deploy this project ever attempted sent all 982 components in one
# request and came back with UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION, zero components deployed, zero component
# errors, and a Salesforce ErrorId. A failure with no component attached tells you nothing
# about which of 982 things caused it. Deploying the vendored tree separately from Open
# Impact's own source, and Core before Giving, means the next such failure names a stage.
#
# It also matches how the packages actually depend on each other: the vendored engine is
# self contained, Core does not call it yet, and Giving depends on Core.
#
# WHY CORE IS SEVERAL STAGES. docs/contributor-guide/ci.md records this same failure
# hitting the undivided Core stage four times across four separate runs before 2026-09-09:
# always UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION, always zero components deployed, always zero component errors,
# always the same trailing code -315522575 behind a different leading number, which is why
# that page calls it a deterministic fault rather than a flake and says a re-run proves
# nothing. It recurred twice more on 2026-09-09, on two separate pushes to main, both times
# on the same undivided Core stage, which by then held 904 components in one request: the
# same shape as the original 982-component failure this file was written to avoid, just
# smaller.
#
# Splitting Core into three (data model, Apex, UI and permissions) followed Salesforce's own
# deploy dependency order and named a stage instead of nothing: the very next run, still on
# 2026-09-09, failed on data model alone, at 853 components. That is the load-bearing data
# point. 853 is close enough to 904 and 982 that a specific bad component stopped being the
# more likely explanation: three deploys of very different content (mostly Apex classes the
# first time, mostly custom fields the second) all failed in the same shape once they got
# into the same few-hundred-to-thousand range. That reads as a size effect, not a component
# defect, though it is still not proven, because nothing about this failure can be proven
# from the client side. It just stopped being a coin flip.
#
# So data model became three stages of its own: `balanced_split` divided
# packages/core/main/default/objects by file count into two roughly equal halves at runtime
# (a hand-written list of object names would go stale the first time someone adds one), and
# customMetadata, labels, static resources and custom permissions formed a third, smaller
# stage. That halving stopped being useful evidence on 2026-09-09: the two halves it produces
# are stable across runs (nothing but file *content* changed in between, and balanced_split
# only looks at file *counts*), and across four consecutive pushes that all fixed real
# component-level errors in "objects B" (139 files, 10 objects), that stage kept failing with
# the same zero-component UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION every single time, while "objects A" (144 files,
# 11 objects, comparable size) deployed clean every one of those four runs. Two same-sized
# groups behaving oppositely and consistently is not a size effect; it is evidence the fault
# tracks something specific to one or more objects inside "objects B".
#
# Objects now deploy one at a time, each its own stage, rather than split into another pair
# of same-content halves that would just repeat this result. That worked immediately: every
# object deployed clean, and it was Address__c's own real component errors (Street__c's
# invalid length, a text area field in a compact layout) that had been hiding behind the
# opaque failure the whole time, not the platform fault recurring on an object.
#
# With objects clear, the platform fault moved to the next stage in line: the four config
# directories (customMetadata, labels, staticresources, customPermissions), deployed together,
# hit it at 568 components. File count there is a badly misleading proxy: around 70 files
# across all four looked nothing like a risk, but `packages/core/main/default/labels/CustomLabels.labels-meta.xml`
# is one file holding 388 individual label components. Config is now three stages: custom
# metadata, labels (isolating that one file), and static resources with custom permissions
# together, since both are a handful of components on any count.
#
# Apex and UI/permissions are unchanged, because neither has failed yet and there is no
# evidence pointing at either.
#
# WHY A PAUSE BETWEEN STAGES. Custom metadata alone, split out from the rest of config,
# still hit the same zero-component UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION at 61 files, confirmed identical on a
# manual re-run (same ErrorId trailing code, same zero components, zero errors). 61 is nowhere
# near the few-hundred-to-thousand range every prior failure has carried, and this is the
# first time a stage that small has failed on its own, so size stops being a workable
# explanation for this occurrence specifically: something else has to be going on. Every stage
# in this script runs as its own blocking `sf project deploy start --wait 30` call, one after
# another, against the one persistent org, with no gap between a stage finishing and the next
# one starting. If the org's deploy engine needs a moment to settle after reporting a deploy
# Done before it can safely accept the next one, back to back calls with no pause would be
# exactly the condition to trigger that. Untested, and not the only remaining explanation, but
# cheap and non-destructive to try: every deploy_stage call now pauses for
# $STAGE_PAUSE_SECONDS after a successful deploy, before the next stage starts.
#
# WHY ASYNC WITH A STALL CHECK. From 2026-09-24 about 13:00 UTC, one stage per run on
# oi-test (a different one each time) sat as a DeployRequest in Status Pending with no
# StartDate until the blocking --wait 30 gave up, so the whole gate failed after 30 minutes.
# Cancelling such a request reports Canceled but leaves it Pending, and a fresh submission of
# the same stage deploys normally. So each stage is submitted with --async and followed with
# short report calls: a job still Pending with no start after STALL_SECONDS (300) is
# cancelled, best effort, and resubmitted once; a second stall fails the stage naming both
# job ids. A job that has started keeps the old 30 minute limit (DEPLOY_WAIT_MINUTES). Each
# report call is abandoned after REPORT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (60): one hung for 290s on 2026-09-24.
# A transient client error (fetch failed, ECONNRESET, a 5xx) on a submit or a report is
# retried, not taken as a failure: the same day one stage failed on "fetch failed" while the
# org reported that deploy Succeeded. After a submit error, the newest DeployRequest from the
# last minute is followed if there is one, so a stage is never deployed twice.
# POLL_SECONDS sets the report interval. `sf` is found on PATH, so a fake one can drive this
# logic in a test.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every stage deployed, non-zero = the first stage that failed.
