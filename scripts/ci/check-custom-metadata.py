"""Checks every shipped custom metadata record against its type definition.

A record that names a field the type does not define deploys nowhere: the
metadata API refuses the whole deployment. The offline Apex compiler does not
see custom metadata records, so nothing else in the check suite catches it.
This ran because three Automation Registry records reached main naming
Default_Enabled__c, a field that belongs to Naming Pattern, not to that type.

It also checks a Setting Definition row against the org it would be installed
into: the field its Setting_Key__c names has to be defined on the settings
object it points at, and its Section__c has to be a section name Core knows.
A row naming a field that is not there deploys cleanly and then tells the
administrator "That setting does not exist in this org" the first time anybody
saves that panel, and a row in a section Core does not know is a section the
Setup Assistant cannot send anybody to.

It also checks the other half of a Setting Definition row whose Data_Type__c is
Component: the settings console can only render a component it names in its own
import switch, because dynamic imports must be statically analyzable. A row
naming a component the console does not import deploys cleanly and then shows
"not installed" to the administrator, which is a defect only a person opening
that page in an org would ever see.

It also checks the shape of every record, because the metadata API reports these
badly or not at all. A record that writes xsi:type="xsd:string" without declaring
the xsd prefix fails the whole deployment with UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION and no component
error, which is what kept every org run red at the custom metadata stage until
2026-09-22. A label longer than 40 characters, or one given as an attribute
instead of a <label> element, fails only in an org.

It also checks every shipped migration import template (Template_Key__c starting
npc_ or npsp_) against its sample export in docs/admin-guide/samples/, named
after the key (npc_gift_transactions reads npc-gift-transactions.csv). The Apex
tests build their rows from the template's own headings, so a heading misspelt
in the template would pass them and then match no column of a real export. The
sample is written the way the export heads its columns: every sample heading has
to be one of the template's source headings, and every template heading has to
be in the sample, except the Fund 2 to Fund 5 and Amount 2 to Amount 5 columns
an administrator adds by hand for a split gift. Headings compare ignoring
capitals, as the importer compares them.
