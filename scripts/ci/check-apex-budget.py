"""Keeps each package's Apex code size under a budget.

Salesforce allows 6,000,000 characters of Apex per org (Apex Developer Guide, Size-Specific
Apex Limits; raisable by a support case). Comments, @IsTest classes and code in managed
packages do not count. BarnCRM installs as unmanaged source with no namespace (ADR-0001), so
every non-test class and trigger counts, beside the org's own code. On 2026-11-04 the full
suite measured 4,280,027 characters (71%), and one landing batch had added 12.5%: an org with
about 1.7M characters of its own Apex could no longer take it (architect review L-01, RT-01).
CI runs on scratch orgs, whose limit is 10,000,000, so no org test notices growth.

Size is measured the way the org measures it (ApexClass.LengthWithoutComments): every
character of a non-test class or trigger except comments. oi-test agreed within 2%.

CAPS is a ceiling per package a little above its measured size, so every addition is a
choice: raise a cap only in the pull request that needs it, and say why. TARGET is where the
trim pass should take the full suite and Core (decision 1, 2026-11-04), leaving an org at
least 2,400,000 characters of its own; above a target the check passes and says by how much.

    python3 scripts/ci/check-apex-budget.py            the check
    python3 scripts/ci/check-apex-budget.py --report   sizes per package, largest classes

scripts/org/install-precheck.py reads package_sizes() to compare an org's room with what
the chosen modules need.
