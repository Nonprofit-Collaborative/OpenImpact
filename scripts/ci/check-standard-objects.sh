# references, as whole
# words, case-sensitive: Opportunity, Campaign, Lead, Case, OpportunityContactRole,
# CampaignMember, PersonAccount, IsPersonAccount, or any Industries GiftTransaction / __dlm
# name. Those objects and fields may only be referenced from packages/mirror and
# packages/mirrorgiving (BarnCRM Mirror for Giving, which holds the gift mirrors since N-09,
# ADR-NEXT mirror independence), and even there behind dynamic Apex (see docs/product-plan.md
# Section 4.2). Neither package is in DIRS below; the rule for both is the same.
#
# Mirror's object and field declarations
# ---------------------------------------
# Mirror's and Mirror for Giving's Apex may name these objects, as strings resolved through
# describe, but their metadata may not: a lookup to Campaign, a formula through Opportunity, or
# a field declared on Opportunity is resolved at deploy time and refuses the install on an org
# without the object (ADR-0013, ADR-0056, ADR-0058). So everything under
# packages/mirror/**/objects/ and packages/mirrorgiving/**/objects/ is checked too: a folder named after one of these objects fails, and so does one of these
# names anywhere in an object, field or list view file outside its prose (label, description,
# help text, and other human-readable values, which are text, not references). This is why
# Appeal__c.Campaign_Id__c is a Text field, not a lookup.
#
# A second pattern covers the Nonprofit Cloud surface: the fundraising objects, the objects a
# household is actually built out of there (PartyRelationshipGroup and AccountContactRelation),
# and the contact point objects that are its answer to an address. It is checked in Apex and
# metadata only, because a Lightning component's JavaScript cannot reference an SObject and
# our own component class names collide with several of these words.
#
# This half was added after an audit found the gate matched GiftTransaction alone. Core could
# have named PartyRelationshipGroup, the object that decides whether an Account is a Nonprofit
# Cloud household, and CI would have passed it.
#
# Detection-only exemptions
# -------------------------
# Detecting that an object exists is not depending on it. Core has to be able to tell an
# administrator what is installed in their org (Health Check, plan Section 4.8), and that
# means holding a few of these names as String constants passed to Schema.getGlobalDescribe
# or to a field map, never as a compile-time reference.
#
# An Apex line (*.cls or *.trigger) that carries the comment
#
#     // detection-only: <reason>
#
# is exempt from this check. Every exempted line is printed on each run so a reviewer sees
# the whole list without going looking for it. The marker is only honored in Apex, only on
# the line it appears on, and it never exempts a compile-time reference: writing
# Opportunity.Name with the marker appended still means Core will not deploy on a
# Platform-only org. Use it on constant declarations and nowhere else, and keep the reason
# specific enough that the next reader can judge it.
#
# See docs/contributor-guide/ci.md, "Detection-only exemptions".
#
# Import template column headings
# -------------------------------
# A shipped import template (customMetadata/Import_Template_Default.*.md-meta.xml) names the
# columns of a file exported from another system, and a Data Loader export of NPSP or Nonprofit
# Cloud heads its columns with that system's field paths, for example
# GiftTransaction.OriginalAmount. Those words are text the importer compares with a file's
# header row; nothing resolves them against this org's schema, so they are not a reference to
# the object and cannot refuse a deployment. Such files are listed on each run, like the
# detection-only lines, and are not failures. Every other file type, and every other custom
# metadata type, is still checked. The test is on the file's path (the part of grep's output
# before the first colon), never on its content, so an Apex comment naming such a path is not
# exempted.
#
# The exemption covers whole files. That is safe only while Import_Template_Default has no
# MetadataRelationship field: such a field is resolved against the org at deploy time, so a
# value naming another system's object would be a real reference. If the type ever gains one,
# revisit this exemption.
#
# Match sources
# -------------
# A shipped match source (customMetadata/Match_Source.*.md-meta.xml) names a related object
# such as ContactPointEmail as text. MatchSourceService resolves it through describe at run
# time and skips a source whose object is absent, so the word refuses no deployment (ADR-0133,
# 0133-related-record-matching.md). These files are listed with the template headings, by
# path, on the same terms: safe only while Match_Source has no MetadataRelationship field.
#
# D-194: a shipped Integration App (customMetadata/Integration_App.*.md-meta.xml) names the other
# product's objects in Detection Objects as text, such as GiftTransaction for Nonprofit Cloud
# Fundraising. IntegrationAppService only looks the names up in the global describe to tell
# whether the product is installed (MIG-10), so the word refuses no deployment. Listed by path
# on the same terms: safe only while Integration_App has no MetadataRelationship field.
