"""Checks that every permission set grants access to metadata that exists.

A permission set naming a class, tab, application, object, field or custom permission that
the packages do not ship fails the whole deployment with a component error, and so does a
permission set group naming a set that is not there. Nothing else in
the check suite sees it: the offline Apex compiler does not read permission sets, and the
canonical model check reads objects and fields rather than who is granted them.

This ran because Nonprofit_Admin granted a Household_Member__c tab that had never been
created. The integration contract asked for that tab, the grant was added, and the tab was
not, so the permission set had been undeployable for as long as it had existed.

The permission sets are assembled by hand at each merge from the integration files, which is
exactly the process that produces this mistake, so it is worth a gate rather than care.

Standard objects and fields are not checked: they exist in the org rather than in this
repository. Only custom API names, which end in __c, are resolved against the packages.

One grant that resolves is still checked, because it cannot be given: View All Records or
Modify All Records on the detail side of a master-detail relationship. Record access to a
detail object comes from its master, and a permission set that asks for it anyway risks
losing the whole objectPermissions entry, and with it the create and edit access the
feature actually needs. Nonprofit_Admin asked for both on Import Row, and the first org run
of the import tests failed on staging a row.

One more grant resolves and still breaks ADR-0013: an object only some licenses may be given.
Salesforce grants DuplicateRecordSet and DuplicateRecordItem only to Sales Cloud and Service
Cloud licenses, so a permission set granting them cannot be assigned to a Salesforce Platform
user. Such objects may appear only in the optional sets named for them, and those sets may be
in no permission set group, because a role has to be assignable to everybody.
