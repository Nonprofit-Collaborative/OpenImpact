"""Checks that every Lightning web component the packages expose can actually be reached.

`isExposed` means an administrator *could* drop the component on a page. It does not mean the
package ships anywhere that does. A component nobody can reach is a feature that does not
exist: it deploys cleanly, it passes every other check, its Jest tests pass, and the admin
guide happily describes a card the administrator will never see.

This has happened four times in this project, which is why it is a gate rather than care:

  * relationshipPanel, affiliationPanel and addressPanel shipped with C-15 to C-17 on no page,
    while three admin guide walkthroughs said "scroll to the card".
  * receiptSettings was named in a Setting Definition Component row, which Core cannot import
    across the package boundary (ADR-0020), so the console rendered "not installed".
  * receiptActions shipped with G-13 on no page, while the receipts walkthrough said "click
    Issue receipt".
  * commitmentSchedulePreview shipped with G-07 on no page and was never mentioned in its guide.

A component counts as reachable when it is placed on a flexipage, invoked by a quick action,
nested inside another component's markup, or named in the settings console's own import
switch. Those are the four ways anything in this package reaches a screen.

The check deliberately says nothing about whether the *page* is reachable in turn: a flexipage
nobody assigns is a different problem, and Salesforce gives us no way to know from source.
