"""Allowlist gate: Core and the modules may name only the standard objects listed here.

Why this exists, next to check-standard-objects.sh
--------------------------------------------------
`check-standard-objects.sh` is a denylist. It fails the build when source names one of
the object names somebody thought to write down. It cannot fail on an object nobody
thought of, which is the failure mode that actually matters: a static Apex reference to
an object a subscriber org does not have is a compile error, and one compile error in one
class refuses the whole package. The product's central compatibility claim (ADR-0009,
ADR-0013, plan Section 4.2) is that Core installs on a Platform-only org, so the gate that
protects it has to be shaped the other way round: everything is forbidden unless it is
listed, and an unrecognized name fails loudly.

The vendored rollup engine (packages/core/vendor, ADR-0015) is inside this gate, not
outside it. It is third party source the project does not write, but it deploys inside
Core's package and a standard object it names is Core's deployment risk exactly like one
Core wrote itself. What the vendor tree gets is its own allowlist section, VENDOR_ONLY
below, with a reason recorded per name. The effect is that today's vendored references are
accepted deliberately and a future upstream upgrade that introduces a new standard object
fails this check instead of being discovered in a subscriber org.

What is scanned, and what is not
--------------------------------
Apex (`*.cls`, `*.trigger`) under every package directory, plus the names of the folders
under `objects/`, which is how a package declares that it extends a standard object.

Names are collected only from positions where a bare identifier can be an SObject type:

  new Name(...)          List<Name>   Set<Name>   Map<..., Name>
  Name.SObjectType       FROM Name    (SOQL, including SOQL inside a string literal)

That is deliberately narrower than every place an SObject can appear. A plain local
declaration (`Account a;`) is not matched, because the same shape is how every Apex system
type is declared and the noise would swamp the signal. Every reference of that kind seen
so far in this repository is accompanied by one of the positions above, so the narrower
set has cost nothing. If that ever stops being true, widen the patterns and extend
SYSTEM_TYPES with whatever falls out: an unknown name fails, so widening is safe.

Names defined in this repository (Apex classes, interfaces, enums, inner types), custom
API names (`__c`, `__mdt`, `__e`, `__x`, `__b`, `__Share`, `__History`) and relationship
names (`__r`) are removed before the allowlist is consulted.

Exit code 1 on any name that is not allowed for the file that names it.
