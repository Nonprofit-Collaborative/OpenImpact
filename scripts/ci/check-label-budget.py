"""Keeps the custom label count under a budget and fails on labels nothing uses.

Salesforce allows 5,000 custom labels per org. Labels in an installed managed package do not
count toward it ("Custom labels from managed packages don't count toward this limit",
Salesforce Help, Custom Labels), but every unpackaged source deploy does: barn-sales, oi-test,
barn-npc and mwdbdevsb all receive BarnCRM as source, beside each org's own labels. barn-sales
reached 4,996 on 2026-11-02 and a deploy failed with "custom label limit exceeded".

BUDGET is the total across every package directory: the count after help prose and then Core's
messages moved to the help catalogs (ADR-0164 help-text-json and D-172, 3,163 on 2026-11-04)
plus a small margin, so every label added is a choice. TARGET is where the total should settle;
above it the check passes and says by how much.

Help prose: help and guidance sentences live in the package's help catalog
(BarnHelp_<Package>.json, docs/contributor-guide/ux-kit.md, Help Text), never in a label. A
label is taken for help prose when its value is a sentence (six words or more, ending as a
sentence does) and the last word of its name is a help word (Intro, Help, Description, Hint,
Note, Notes, Empty, Why, What, Steps, Text, Tooltip, Explanation), unless the name says it is
an error or log line or the value has a {0} placeholder (a message about the current state).
PROSE_EXCEPTIONS lists the few that must stay labels, with the reason.

Unused: a label whose name appears in no file under packages/ other than the label files
(Markdown and code comments do not count). Apex, LWC, Aura, Visualforce, flows, FlexiPages
and custom metadata records all name a label in full, including the names read with
System.Label.get, so a whole-word search finds every real reference. A label referenced
only by a name built from pieces at run time would be missed: there is none, and building
one is not allowed (write the full name so this check, and a reader, can find it).

# Raised from 3,215 on 2026-11-07 for Batch C's three new modules (Forms, Contact Point Sync,
# Event Management: 59 labels) and its Core and Volunteers items (C-61/C-63, C-69, V-10b); the
# check below already holds no unused label and no help prose. A module's labels reach an org
# only when that module is installed. Raised by 8 for EV-02's Registrations tab (11 short button
# and menu labels; its messages are help catalog text), and by 1 for EV-14's nightly step name
# and 1 for EV-10's.
# Batch C wave 2 landing: set to the merged total, 3,259: 17 Events labels, EV-02's Registrations
# tab and 11 button and menu labels, the EV-10 and EV-14 nightly step names, and the EV-06
# Applications, EV-09 Sponsors, EV-12 Check-In and EV-15 Appointments tab titles.
# Batch C wave 3 landing: set to the merged total, 3,261: the EV-13 Seating and EV-17 Badges tab
# titles (a flexipage tab title cannot read the help catalog).
# Batch C review: lowered to 3,255 after merging six labels that held the same name for the same
# thing (Super Importer, Opportunity Mirror, Gift Transaction Mirror, Seasonal Address Swap, "or").
# Raised by 1 for Mirror_Sync_Compare: Mirror's two pages read a Rollups label before.
# Lowered to 3,254 after merging two more same-text pairs (Households, Choose a kind of record).
# Raised by 1 for Volunteers_Access_AddOnCoordinator: Volunteers Coordinator becomes an Access page
# extra permission (simpler permission sets, D1); the Mirror merge in the same release removes 3.
# Combined build (landing/batch-d-i): set to the merged total, 3,258, for C-62 Merge Records' three
# labels (C-67 used the last three); AR-01b (release 1.19) moves module messages out and lowers it.
# Raised to 3,259 for the Migration Assistant (MIG-01, MIG-08) merged total, and to 3,261 for the
# Volunteers hour value card and thank-you nightly step name (V-12, V-13).
# AR-01b (release 1.19, D-172): 834 module messages moved to the help catalogs; lowered to the
# merged total, 2,427. TARGET follows plan AR-01's expected suite of about 2,400.
# W10: Programs_NightlyJobs_SchedulesName moved to the Programs help catalog; lowered to 2,426.
# N-09: raised by 1 for Mirror_Access_AddOnProviderRequests, the Access page sentence of the
# Provider Requests set Mirror ships now that Salesforce Records Sync is Mirror for Giving's
# (an Access Add-On row names its sentence as a label, which AccessService reads by name).
