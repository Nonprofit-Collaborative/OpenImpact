"""Checks that every packaged Lightning record page is actually assigned to something.

`check-components-reachable.py` proves a component is on a page. It says so in its own
header, it deliberately says nothing about whether that page is ever shown, and that is the
hole this gate closes. A FlexiPage cannot name the record type it serves: the assignment
lives in a Lightning app's `actionOverrides`, or in the object's own `actionOverrides` for
the org default. Ship the page without one and Salesforce keeps showing the standard record
page, so the component is on a page nobody opens.

This is the same defect class as an unreachable component, one level up: it deploys, every
test passes, and the administrator sees none of it until they wire it up by hand in the
Lightning App Builder. It ran because `Household_Record_Page` carried `householdMembersPanel`
and `Nonprofit_Hub.app-meta.xml` carried no `actionOverrides` at all, so the household
walkthrough failed at step 4 on every fresh install, and because `Gift_Record_Page` and
`Commitment_Record_Page` were stranded the same way in the Fundraising app.

Two things are checked:

  1. Every RecordPage flexipage the packages ship is named by at least one assignment.
  2. An app that assigns a page covers every form factor the app itself declares. An app
     that declares Large and Small and assigns a page for Large only is a phone user looking
     at the standard page, which is the same defect on a smaller screen.

Vendored source is out of scope: the globs only reach `packages/*/main/default`.
