"""Fails if an Apex test runs as whoever deploys or runs the tests.

From API version 67.0 a query or DML statement with no access mode runs in user
mode, in test classes too. A test that runs as the deploying user therefore passes
only where that person already holds the BarnCRM permission sets. The org test
gate assigns them to no one, and a check-only deploy, a subscriber org or another
administrator may not have them, and such a test fails there with "fields being
inaccessible", "No such column" or "You need the Manage BarnCRM Settings
permission". A check-only deploy to a real sandbox failed 565 of 1008 Core tests
this way.

So in packages/core, packages/rollups, packages/giving, packages/volunteers, packages/programs, packages/logicmodels, packages/funders, packages/forms, packages/contactpoints, packages/events, packages/portal, packages/mirror and packages/mirrorgiving every @IsTest method
and every @TestSetup method calls System.runAs, normally as TestUsers.admin() or TestUsers.adminWith(...), which
creates a user holding the packaged permission sets inside the test
(docs/contributor-guide/ci.md, "Tests run as a user they create").

A test that touches no data and no permission dependent code may say so instead,
with a comment naming why:

    // runs-as: deploying user (pure logic: parses a filter document, no DML or SOQL)

placed anywhere in the class to cover every method, or inside one method (or on
the lines between the previous method and its annotation) to cover that method.

A @TestSetup method whose body only calls TestUsers (creating the class's test
user once, so its test methods find it instead of each creating one) needs no
runAs. And a TestUsers call made in two or more test methods of a class must also
be made in a @TestSetup of that class: TestUsers keeps a user per transaction
only, so otherwise every test method inserts the user and its permission set
assignments again.
