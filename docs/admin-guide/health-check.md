# Health Check

## What It Does

Health Check looks at your org and tells you, in plain language, whether BarnCRM is set
up the way it should be. It reports what it found in your org (what else is installed, which
licenses are in play), whether your coexistence mode matches that, who can and cannot get
into the app, and anything that is currently getting in the way, such as paused automation
or errors nobody has looked at.

Every finding says what is wrong and what to do about it, and most of them have a button.
Some buttons take you to the page where you decide. Others fix the problem on the spot, but
only when there is exactly one right answer, and only after you confirm (see **How a fix
button works** below).

Run it after you install, after you add people, and any time something feels wrong.

## How to Turn It On

Health Check belongs to the **Org Optimizer and Health Check** feature, which on a new
install is off until you turn it on: choose **Turn On** in that row in **BarnCRM Settings**,
**General** (or leave it ticked in first-run setup); see
[BarnCRM Settings](barncrm-settings.md). Once it is on there is nothing else to enable and
nothing to configure.

Health Check's one home is **Org Optimizer**:

1. Open the **BarnCRM Admin** app.
2. Click the **Org Optimizer** tab and choose **Health Check** (in the list on the left, or
   in the **Show** box on a phone).
3. The section shows the last full run. Click **Run Health Check** the first time, and
   **Run Again** whenever you want a fresh look.

**BarnCRM Settings**, **Health** keeps Health Check's settings and an **Open Health Check**
link that opens this section.

An administrator also finds Health Check on the BarnCRM home page, under the setup
checklist. Home does not run every check each time it opens, because a full run reads a lot
of your org and Home is the page everyone opens first. Instead it shows a summary of the last
result: a badge (**Needs Fixing: 2**, **Worth Knowing: 3**, **All Clear**, or **Not Run
Yet**, the same badge as the Health Check tile in Org Optimizer, in the same words as the
report's findings), when Health Check last ran in full for an
administrator, and how many findings it had to fix, to be aware of and for your information.
Click **Run Health Check** to run it in full there and see the whole report, with each finding as a
row (the same component, and the same rows, as Org Optimizer's Health Check section); after
that the button reads **Run Again**. Until
Health Check has run once, Home says so and offers **Run Health Check**. A run by
someone without the **Manage BarnCRM Settings** permission is not kept as the last result,
because it skips the access checks.

Org Optimizer is the way in that always works, including for an org where someone removed
the home page copy from the page.

To act on a finding you need the **Manage BarnCRM Settings** permission, which the
BarnCRM Admin role includes. Without it you can still read most of the report: the page says
so at the top and the Fix buttons are hidden. Three checks are skipped for you rather than
answered wrongly, because Salesforce only lets you see your own access: who holds the
BarnCRM Admin role, who holds the Override Receipt Lock permission (asked only where Giving is installed), and how many errors
nobody has read. In their place you get one line, **Only a BarnCRM Admin can see the
access checks**.

## A Five-Minute Walkthrough

Maria has just installed BarnCRM into her organization's Salesforce org. Person Accounts
are on, and nothing else that keeps households is installed. She has not set anything up
yet.

1. Maria opens the **BarnCRM Admin** app, clicks **Org Optimizer**, chooses **Health
   Check**, and clicks **Run Health Check**.
2. The first card is **What We Found in Your Org**. It says Person Accounts are enabled.
   Under it, the card shows the mode this org is in now and the mode BarnCRM recommends:
   **Standalone**.
3. Below the card, the findings are grouped: **Your Org**, **Licenses**, **Access**, and
   **Settings**. Each finding has an icon: a red circle for something that needs fixing, an
   amber triangle for something to be aware of, a blue dot for information.
4. The first finding is blue, **Your Org at a Glance**, and it repeats what was found in a
   sentence, adds that BarnCRM supports this org shape directly, and says that Shield
   Platform Encryption cannot be detected from inside the app. If her org uses it, she should
   say so before she loads data.
5. The next finding is amber: **Coexistence Mode Is Not Confirmed Yet**. It explains which
   mode BarnCRM recommends for what it found. There is a button, **Use Recommended Mode**.
6. Maria clicks **Use Recommended Mode**. The confirm box says what changes, starting
   **Coexistence mode (how BarnCRM shares people and households with NPSP or Nonprofit Cloud)
   changes from**, and she clicks **Confirm**. The page saves Standalone and re-runs. The amber
   finding is replaced by a blue one: **Coexistence Mode Matches Your Org**. If household
   membership were still set to the person's account, the red finding **Household
   membership does not fit Person Accounts** would offer its own one-click fix.
7. Under **Access** there is a red finding: **No One Is Assigned the BarnCRM Admin Role**.
   She clicks **Open the Access Page**, which takes her to the Access section of BarnCRM
   Settings, adds herself, and comes back to Org Optimizer's Health Check.
8. Another finding is amber: **4 Users Cannot See the App**. Four active users have a
   Salesforce license but none of the BarnCRM roles, so the BarnCRM app is invisible to
   them. She clicks **Open the Access Page** again and assigns roles.
9. She clicks **Run Again**. The red finding is gone, the amber ones are gone, and what is left
   is blue: her org shape, the mode, and **Automation Is Running Normally**.

Total time: about five minutes, most of it assigning roles.

**Only if your org has NPSP or Nonprofit Cloud.** With the Nonprofit Success Pack, step 2
reads **NPSP detected** and the recommendation is **NPSP coexistence**. With Nonprofit Cloud,
step 2 reads **Nonprofit Cloud objects detected**, the recommendation is **Nonprofit Cloud
coexistence**, and **Use Recommended Mode** switches household membership to the flexible way of belonging, with one membership record per person,
with it. If that org has Nonprofit Cloud gift objects and the Mirror for Giving module is not
installed, there is also a blue finding, **The Gift Transaction Mirror Is in the Mirror for
Giving Module**: install Mirror and Mirror for Giving if you want Nonprofit Cloud's own
summaries to keep working.
Nothing is broken today.

## What Health Check Looks At

| Group | What it checks |
|---|---|
| Your Org | What else is installed: Person Accounts, Nonprofit Cloud objects, the Nonprofit Success Pack, standard Sales and Service Cloud objects. |
| Your Org | Whether your coexistence mode matches what was found. |
| Your Org | Whether household membership is still set to the person's account while Person Accounts are on, which does not work. |
| Your Org | Only with Nonprofit Cloud: whether your org has Nonprofit Cloud gift objects while the Mirror for Giving module is not installed. |
| Settings | Whether household membership uses membership records while automatic household creation is off, which means no new person gets a household. |
| Licenses | Whether the org uses more than one currency, which BarnCRM does not support yet. |
| Access | Whether anyone holds the BarnCRM Admin role. |
| Access | Whether active users with a Salesforce license have no BarnCRM role at all. |
| Access | With Giving: whether anyone holds the Override Receipt Lock permission, which is meant to be granted for one correction and taken away again. |
| Settings | Whether BarnCRM automation is paused, and says so plainly when it is running. A pause that nothing is set to end, or that ends more than 24 hours from now, is a warning. |
| Settings | Whether there are new entries in the Error Log that nobody has looked at. Past 1,000 it stops counting and says **1,000 or more**, so a flooded Error Log cannot slow down or break the report. |
| Settings | Whether the error digest is scheduled but has not run for more than two days, which usually means the person who scheduled it was deactivated. |
| Settings | Whether anybody is in no household while every new person is meant to get one. |
| Settings | Whether Households is on while NPSP households are in use (**NPSP and BarnCRM Both Make Households**, a warning). Turning Households on is refused while they are, but nothing else checks afterwards, so NPSP installed or its Account Model set to Household Account later would leave both making a household for the same person. **Open NPSP Household Adoption** opens **General**, where the adoption panel is; see [Adopting Your NPSP Households](npsp-households.md#then-turn-on-households). |
| Settings | Whether any household has nobody in it. |
| Settings | Whether any relationship has no person on one side, or any affiliation has no person, because the person was deleted. |
| Settings | Whether your org uses a custom fiscal year (**Your Org Uses a Custom Fiscal Year**, information only). BarnCRM totals for this year, last year and two years ago run in whole years from the month your fiscal year starts in Setup; reports filtered or grouped by fiscal year follow your custom periods, so where a custom year starts on another day or is not twelve months long, the two can disagree. Only Setup can change it, so there is no fix button. With a standard fiscal year there is nothing to report: BarnCRM uses the same fiscal year as your reports. |
| Settings | Whether you can use the record type chosen in **Record type for organizations** (**You Cannot Use the Record Type for Organizations**, a warning). BarnCRM's permission sets give no Account record type, so after an upgrade from a version that shipped Organization the record type stays but the access goes. Give it on the profiles or permission sets of everyone who creates organizations, or choose one they have; see [BarnCRM Settings](barncrm-settings.md#record-type-for-organizations). Health Check can only read your own access, so check the others' profiles too. |
| Settings | With Giving: whether receipts have been voided with the reason "Generation failed", which is a receipt run that did not finish. |
| Settings | With the Rollup Builder module: whether any of the totals BarnCRM ships are missing from the Rollup Builder. |
| Settings | Whether any BarnCRM automation is missing its on and off switch on the Automation page. |
| Settings | Whether any import template BarnCRM ships is missing from the Import page. |
| Settings | Whether the one nightly run, **BarnCRM Nightly Jobs**, or the hourly tab access check is not scheduled. The nightly run takes every BarnCRM nightly job in turn, Core's and each installed module's (see [Nightly Jobs](nightly-jobs.md)); each job is switched on and off on its own page. |
| Settings | Whether any scheduled BarnCRM job belongs to a person who has been deactivated. A scheduled job runs as the person who scheduled it, and stops running the day that person is deactivated, while it still looks scheduled on its page. |
| Settings | Whether Core or any installed module never ran the setup steps its package install runs, which happens when source is copied into an org by hand (**Setup never ran for** followed by the names). Its **Finish Setup** button runs those steps. |
| Settings | With the Rollup Builder module: whether a total is set to be recalculated nightly while the nightly run is not scheduled. |
| Settings | With the Rollup Builder module: whether totals waiting in the rollup queue failed five times (the Error Log says why), or have waited more than an hour. **Open Needs Attention** takes you to the Rollup Builder, where **Retry** and **Start Now** put them through again. |
| Settings | With Giving: whether any gift dated in a closed accounting period has not been marked posted to accounting. |
| Settings | With Mirror for Giving: whether the Opportunity mirror's nightly run is scheduled but has not completed a run for more than two days. |
| Settings | With Mirror for Giving, in an org with Nonprofit Cloud fundraising: the same question for the Gift Transaction mirror. |
| Settings | With Volunteers: hours waiting more than 14 days for approval, past shifts nobody closed, shift schedules that have not created shifts far enough ahead, and shipped volunteer totals turned off. See [Volunteers, Health Check findings](volunteers.md#health-check-findings). |
| Settings | With Programs: enrollments still open in a program that has ended. See [Programs, Health Check](programs.md#health-check). |
| Your Org | With Programs: whether your org also has Nonprofit Cloud Program Management. Information only: choose one for each program. See [Programs, Health Check](programs.md#health-check). |
| Settings | Whether one user who has a role owns more than 10,000 households (**One User Owns Too Many Accounts**, a warning), and with Giving the same for gifts. A role or sharing change then recalculates access to all of those records at once, which can lock them and slow saves. Give some of them to other owners or to a user with no role. Health Check samples the owners of the newest 200 records and counts at most three of them, the ones who own the most of that sample first, so a very large org is checked without reading every record. |
| Settings | With Giving: whether any fund or appeal has more than 10,000 gifts (**Funds or Appeals With Very Many Gifts**, information only), read from their Gift Count totals. Each gift saved against one briefly locks it, so load their gifts serially or in smaller batches. |
| Settings | Whether addresses saved before version 1.22 still lack their Match Key (**Match Keys Not Filled**, information only). Until they have one, the duplicate scan and import matching search every street to compare addresses. **Fill Match Keys** gives every address its key in the background and changes nothing else; see [Duplicates](duplicates.md). |
| Settings | **Not Checked, Run Again** (a warning): Health Check stopped early to stay inside the limits Salesforce sets on one request, and names the checks it left. The findings above it are still accurate; run Health Check again. A very large org may see this every time for its last few checks. |

Five of those need a module: the Override Receipt Lock permission, the failed receipts, the
unposted gifts in a closed period (all with Giving), and the stalled Opportunity and Gift
Transaction mirrors (with Mirror for Giving). Each one is a quiet problem, where nothing looks broken and
the cost arrives months later, so each is explained in full below.

## The Five Quiet Findings

| Finding | What it means | Why it matters | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Someone Can Override the Receipt Lock** (with Giving) | One or more active people hold the **Override Receipt Lock** permission. BarnCRM ships it assigned to nobody. | That permission is the only way to change or delete a gift that carries a receipt number. It is meant to be granted in Setup for one correction and removed the same day. Left assigned, the guarantee that a receipted gift cannot change quietly stops being a guarantee, and nothing in the app will tell you again. | Read the names in the finding. If nobody is in the middle of a correction right now, open **Setup, Custom Permissions, Override Receipt Lock** and take it off the permission set or profile that grants it. Every change made with it is already in the Error Log at Warning severity, so you can see what it was used for. |
| **Receipts Failed to Generate** (with Giving) | There are receipts with status **Void** and the reason **Generation failed**. | Every receipt number is used once. When a document fails to generate after its number was handed out, BarnCRM records the number as a void receipt so an auditor asking what happened to number 47 gets an answer. One of those is ordinary. A number of them means receipt generation is failing over and over, donors are not getting the documents they are waiting for, and nobody has looked. | Open the Error Log from the finding and read the receipt entries: they say what failed. Fix the cause (most often a missing letter template or a donor with no address), then re-run the receipt or the statement run. The void records stay: they are the audit trail for the numbers that were consumed, and deleting them is not a fix. |
| **Gifts in a Closed Period Are Not Posted** (with Giving) | One or more gifts are dated on or before **Books Closed Through**, so they are already locked from editing, but nothing has marked them **Posted to Accounting**. | A gift in this state fell into a closed period without the ordinary export-and-mark step ever reaching it: the period was closed before it was exported, or it was entered after the close. Either way, your books and BarnCRM can quietly disagree about what has actually been recorded, and the gift is now locked, so nobody can fix it by editing the gift itself. | Read the linked gifts. If they genuinely belong in the export you already sent your accounting system, mark them posted from the **Accounting Export** page in Mirror for Giving. Without Mirror for Giving, or if they should not have been closed yet, move **Books Closed Through** back on the Accounting Periods page, which needs the **Override Posting Lock** permission and is written to the Error Log. The **Open Giving settings** button on the finding opens the Giving section, which the Accounting Periods page lives in. |
| **The Opportunity Mirror Has Not Run** (with Mirror for Giving) | The Opportunity mirror's nightly run is scheduled and a direction is chosen, but no run has completed for more than two days. | The scheduled run executes as the person who scheduled it. When that person is deactivated, or loses the Opportunity Mirror permission set or Opportunity access, every run fails before it starts, and gifts and Opportunities quietly drift apart. | Open **Opportunity mirror** from the Giving section of BarnCRM Settings, read **Last completed run**, then **Stop Nightly Run** and **Schedule nightly** again as someone who can still run it. The Error Log says why the runs failed. |
| **The Gift Transaction Mirror Has Not Run** (with Mirror for Giving) | The Gift Transaction mirror's nightly run is scheduled and its direction is chosen, but no run has completed for more than two days. | The same as for the Opportunity mirror: the run executes as the person who scheduled it, and without their access, or the Fundraising User permission in Nonprofit Cloud, gifts and Nonprofit Cloud's donor summaries quietly drift apart. A run that had to leave some gifts for want of room is not counted as completed either. | Open **Gift Transaction Mirror** from the Giving section of BarnCRM Settings, read **Last completed run** and the Error Log, then **Stop Nightly Run** and **Schedule Nightly Run** again as someone who can still run it ([Gift Transaction Mirror](gift-transaction-mirror.md)). |

With Rollup Builder in an org that also runs DLRS, Health Check warns **BarnCRM and DLRS fill
the same field** when an active BarnCRM rollup and an active DLRS rollup write the same field,
naming each field and both rollups, with **Open the Rollup Builder**. Switch one of each pair
off. See
[When BarnCRM and DLRS Fill the Same Field](rollups.md#when-barncrm-and-dlrs-fill-the-same-field).

## How a Fix Button Works

Most buttons open a page. A button that changes something in your org works like this:

1. The finding says exactly what the fix will do, counted from your org: for example, with
   Giving, **3 Shipped Totals Are Missing**, followed by their names (Total Gifts, Largest
   Gift, Last Gift Date) and what the fix will create.
2. Click the button. A dialog headed **Before This Fix Runs** opens over the page and shows
   that sentence again with **Confirm** and **Cancel**. Nothing has changed yet. **Cancel**,
   the close button, or the Escape key closes it and takes you back to the button.
3. Click **Confirm**. The fix runs, the panel says what it did (for example **Done. Created:
   Total Gifts, Largest Gift, Last Gift Date.**), and Health Check re-runs underneath it. If it
   fails, nothing is changed, the panel says so in a sentence, and the details are in the Error
   Log.

The fix creates exactly what the box showed you. If something changed since Health Check last
ran, for example a colleague restored the same totals a minute ago, the fix does nothing, says
so, and Health Check runs again so you can read the finding as it is now.

Every fix that runs is recorded under **Recent Changes** at the bottom of the **General** section of BarnCRM Settings, as
**Health Check:** followed by the button's name, with what it created, your name and the time.

Every fix only creates something that is missing or switches on something that is off. No
fix deletes anything or changes a value you chose, and pressing it twice does no more than
pressing it once. The one fix that stops something stops only jobs that have already stopped
running, because their owner was deactivated, and schedules them again as you. Most can be
undone on their own page:

| Finding | What the fix does | How to undo it |
|---|---|---|
| **Shipped totals are missing** | Creates the missing totals exactly as shipped. Each one starts calculating straight away, as it would have from install. Your own totals are not touched, and a shipped total whose field one of your own active totals already writes is skipped and named, so the two never overwrite each other. | Switch a total off in the Rollup Builder. Do not delete it: a deleted shipped total comes back the next time totals are restored or the package is upgraded (see Rollups). |
| **Automation switches are missing** | Creates the missing switches, each set to its shipped default, so nothing that runs now stops. An automation that always runs (with Giving, such as the receipt lock) is listed with its switch locked. | Switch any automation off on the Automation page. |
| **Shipped import templates are missing** | Creates the missing templates. | There is no undo in the app: the Import page cannot delete or switch off a template. A template does nothing until somebody picks it for an import. |
| **Nightly Jobs Are Not Scheduled** | Replaces any job still scheduled on its own from an earlier version, then schedules the nightly run and the hourly check, to run as you. One already scheduled is left alone. | Switch any one job off on the **Nightly Jobs** panel in BarnCRM Settings, General (which lists them all, Giving's among them), or on its own page where it has one: the Rollup Builder, the Addresses section and the Error Log section of BarnCRM Settings, and the Opportunity mirror page for Mirror. |
| **Match Keys Not Filled** | Starts a background job, 200 addresses at a time, that gives every address saved before version 1.22 its Match Key, then marks the keys filled, so duplicate matching reads addresses by key. Nothing else on an address changes. If Salesforce is busy with other background jobs, it says so and you try again in a few minutes. In an org where no address is left without a key (a new org, where every address gets its key when saved), Health Check marks the keys filled itself and the finding does not appear. | Nothing to undo: the key only speeds up matching, and BarnCRM keeps it up to date on every save. |
| **Scheduled Jobs Belong to a Deactivated Person** | Stops each job the finding lists and schedules it again at its usual time, to run as you. The end of a running automation pause is scheduled again too. A job Health Check never schedules for you, such as the acknowledgment send (it emails donors), is stopped and named, so you can schedule it again on its own page. | Stop any one of them on its own page, as for the finding above. |
| **Setup never ran for** a package (Core or a module) | Runs the setup steps the package's install runs, for every package the finding names, with you standing in for the installer, then records that they ran: for Core, its automation switches, import templates, coexistence mode, hourly tab access check and your BarnCRM Admin access; for a module, its own switches, templates, shipped totals and records, and its administrator access. The panel says **Done. Setup steps ran for:** and the names. This is a recovery step for source copied into an org by hand: install BarnCRM as packages, which run these steps themselves. The same button is on the module's row on the Modules page. | Each step only adds what is missing, so there is nothing to undo; switch off anything you do not want on its own page. |
| **Coexistence Mode Is Not Confirmed**, **Household Membership Does Not Fit Person Accounts**, **No New Person Is Getting a Household** | As described in the walkthrough and Common mistakes. | Change the setting back in BarnCRM Settings. |

Some findings deliberately have no fix button, because the answer is yours to choose: who
should be a BarnCRM Admin when nobody is, whether paused automation should resume, what
to do about errors in the Error Log, and what should become of a person with no household or
a household with nobody in it.

## People with No Household, and Households with Nobody in Them

Health Check finds these and links them; it never changes them. To see every one of them, and
other record checks such as addresses with parts missing, use **Data Quality** on the **Org Optimizer** tab, which
opens each list in Find (see [Data Quality](data-hygiene.md), which also says how the two
differ). Health Check is about whether BarnCRM is set up right; Data Quality is about
the records themselves.

| Finding | Who is counted | Who is not counted | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **People are not in a household** (amber) | With household membership on the person's account: every contact with no account. With membership records: every person, contact or person account, with no current membership (no end date, or one still to come). | A contact whose account is an organization: that person belongs to the organization. With membership records, a contact linked straight to a household: the separate membership finding covers it. Nobody at all while automatic household creation is off, because then a person without a household is your choice. | Open each linked person. With membership on the account, set the account to a household. With membership records, add them from the household's members panel. |
| **Households have nobody in them** (blue) | Households with no contact on them, or with membership records, no current member. | Organizations. | Open each linked household and add a member, merge it into another household, or delete it. Some are kept on purpose, for example when **Delete empty households** is off (BarnCRM Settings, People and Households), or when merging two people emptied it: a merge never deletes a household, because records can still point at it, so merge it into the kept person's household (see Duplicates). A household kept because gifts or other records are credited to it, such as volunteer hours, is kept on purpose too: deleting it removes that link from those records. |

Each finding counts up to 1,000 and then says **More than 1,000**, so a large org gets its
answer quickly, and links the first five records, oldest first. The counts use your own
access, so these two findings are shown only to people with the Manage BarnCRM Settings
permission. Only in an org that also has Nonprofit Cloud households: some of the people and
households listed may belong to one: BarnCRM cannot see that membership, and the finding
says so.

The checks about shipped totals, switches, templates and nightly jobs are shown only to
people with the Manage BarnCRM Settings permission, because only they can act on them. The
two household checks are shown only to them too, for the reason given above.

If one check cannot run, the rest still run. The check that failed appears as its own finding
saying so, and the details are written to the Error Log.

## Relationships and Affiliations with No Person

When a person is deleted (not merged), the relationships that named them are left with nobody on that side, and their affiliations are left with no person. Merging two people moves these records to the kept person, so they are only left blank by a delete. Health Check finds them and links the first five; it never changes or deletes them.

| Finding | Who is counted | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Relationships have no person on one side** (amber) | Every relationship with no contact and no person account on either side. These cannot be edited until the missing person is chosen again. | Open each linked relationship and choose the missing person, or delete the relationship. |
| **Affiliations have no person** (amber) | Every affiliation with no contact and no person account. They show as an unnamed person. | Open each linked affiliation and choose the person, or delete the affiliation. |

Each finding counts up to 1,000 and then says **More than 1,000**. Both are shown only to people with the Manage BarnCRM Settings permission.

## Common Mistakes

**Treating an amber finding as a failure.** Amber means "be aware of this", not "broken".
Multi-currency, for example, is amber forever if your org uses more than one currency: BarnCRM will not break, it simply does not do currency conversion yet, and there is nothing
you can do to make the finding go away.

**Leaving "no new person is getting a household" unfixed.** That red finding means household
membership is set to the flexible mode and "create a household automatically" is off, so
every person saved from now on is left without a household and nothing else says so. Click
**Turn On Automatic Households** on the finding. If your org groups people another way and
means to leave it off, the finding stays, and it stays red, because the people being saved
today are the ones somebody has to group by hand later.

**Ignoring the red membership finding in a Person Accounts org.** "Household membership does
not fit Person Accounts" is red for a reason: in that state, new households are built through
the person's account, which in a Person Accounts org is the person. Click **Switch to the Flexible Way of Belonging** and the app fixes it for you. The longer it waits, the more households have to be
sorted out afterward.

**Fixing access by editing profiles.** Health Check counts the packaged roles the Access page
assigns, and the packaged permission sets behind them if you assigned one by hand. A profile
change or a permission set of your own may well let someone in, but Health Check will still
list them, because the packaged roles are what the app relies on.

**Reading the access findings from someone else's screen.** Salesforce only lets a person see
their own access, so for anyone without the Manage BarnCRM Settings permission Health Check
skips the two access counts rather than printing a number it cannot stand behind. If the report
you are looking at says **Only a BarnCRM Admin Can See the Access Checks**, that is why:
run it again as an administrator.

**Treating the Override Receipt Lock finding as a formality (with Giving).** It is amber rather than red
because the permission may be legitimately assigned for the next ten minutes. It is on the
report because the failure mode is forgetting: nobody notices a permission that is still
assigned six months later, and while it is assigned, an issued receipt no longer means the
gift behind it cannot change.

**Looking for a fiscal year setting in BarnCRM.** There is none to keep in step: BarnCRM uses
your org's fiscal year from Setup. Change it in **Setup, Company Settings, Fiscal Year**, then
recalculate rollups.

**Deleting the "Generation failed" receipts to clear the finding (with Giving).** Those records are what
account for the numbers that were used. Deleting them turns an explained gap into an
unexplained one, and the receipts still will not generate. Fix the cause and re-run.

**Expecting a fix to tidy up.** The fixes only ever add what is missing. An automation switch
left behind by an older version, or a total you created yourself, stays where it is. Nothing
runs an automation whose switch is left over, so it does no harm.

**Waiting for install to schedule the nightly jobs.** Nothing is scheduled when BarnCRM is
installed, because a scheduled job runs as the person who scheduled it. Press **Schedule all
nightly jobs** once, as the administrator the jobs should run as. If that person later leaves
and is deactivated, Health Check says so: press **Schedule Them Again as Me** on that finding.

**Wondering why "Nightly Totals Are Not Scheduled" has no button.** It explains what an
unscheduled rollup run costs you. The button that fixes it is **Schedule All Nightly Jobs**, on
the nightly jobs finding. The totals finding only appears while at least one total is set to
Scheduled or Both.

**Leaving automation paused.** Pausing automation for a bulk load is exactly right. Forgetting
to turn it back on means households stop being created and names stop being recomputed, quietly.
That is why the paused finding is always shown, with the time it expires. If you see it and you
are not in the middle of a load, resume automation. If it says **Automation is paused with no
automatic resume**, the pause will not end by itself on time: it was started before automatic
resume existed, or somewhere other than the Automation page. Resume it there and pause again
for a set time if you need to (see the [Automation control page](automation-control.md)).
