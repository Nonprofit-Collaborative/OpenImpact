# Access: give a colleague access by name and role

## What it does

Access lets you give a colleague what they need to do their job by picking their name and
choosing a role, for example Fundraising Staff or Program Staff. You never have to learn
what a permission set is, and you never have to open Salesforce Setup to change someone's
role. The page also shows you, at a glance, who currently holds each role, so you can
answer "who can see our giving records?" in a few seconds.

Roles ship with Open Impact and are kept up to date for you. When you turn on a module
later, that module adds what it needs to the roles it belongs to, so the people already in
a role get the new access without you touching anything.

The five roles are:

| Role | Who it is for | What it gives |
|---|---|---|
| Nonprofit Admin | The person who configures the app, usually you | Everything, including Nonprofit Settings |
| Fundraising Staff | Development and fundraising staff | Day to day work with people, households, and giving |
| Program Staff | Program and services staff | Day to day work with people, households, and program records |
| Volunteer Coordinator | Whoever schedules and tracks volunteers | Day to day work with people, households, and volunteer records |
| Read Only | Board members, auditors, and anyone who should look but not change | Read access, no editing |

## How to turn it on

There is nothing to turn on. Access is part of Open Impact Core and appears in Nonprofit
Settings as soon as the package is installed.

The person who installs Open Impact is given the Nonprofit Admin role automatically, at
install and again at every upgrade, so there is always at least one person who can use this
page. If that person was you, you can start straight away.

Two things control who can use the page:

1. You need the Manage Nonprofit Settings permission, which comes with the Nonprofit Admin
   role. Anyone without it sees the page in read-only mode with a notice explaining why.
2. The person you are giving a role to must already be a Salesforce user with a license.
   Creating users is one of the few things Salesforce does not let an app do for you, so
   that step happens in Setup. See "What still needs Setup" below.

## A five-minute walkthrough

Maria has just hired David as Development Director. His Salesforce user already exists.
Here is how she gives him access, checks it, and takes it away again.

1. Open the Nonprofit Hub app and click the **Nonprofit Settings** tab.
2. In the left navigation, choose **Access**. You see five role cards, each with a short
   description and the people who currently hold that role. On a fresh install only your
   own name appears, under Nonprofit Admin.
3. In the **Find a person** box, type `David`. Matching active users appear as you type,
   each with their name and email address so you can tell two Davids apart.
4. Choose **David Okafor**.
5. Choose the role **Fundraising Staff** and click **Give access**. A confirmation asks you
   to confirm the person and the role. Click **Give access** again.
6. A message says "David Okafor now has the Fundraising Staff role." David's name appears
   on the Fundraising Staff card, and the number in brackets beside the role name goes up
   by one.
7. David can now sign in and see gifts, households, and contacts. He does not see Nonprofit
   Settings, because that belongs to the Nonprofit Admin role.
8. To take the role away, find David's name on the Fundraising Staff card and click
   **Remove**. Confirm, and a message says "David Okafor no longer has the Fundraising
   Staff role." His name disappears from the card.

A person can hold more than one role. Giving David the Program Staff role as well does not
remove Fundraising Staff, and removing one role leaves the other in place. Giving someone a
role they already have changes nothing and reports no error.

## What still needs Setup

Open Impact can give a person a role, but it cannot create the person or hand out a
Salesforce license. Only Salesforce Setup can do that, because licenses are billed and
managed by Salesforce rather than by an installed app.

So the order is always: create the user in Setup first, then give them a role here.

The **Create a user in Setup** link on the Access page opens the Users page in Setup in a
new tab. The address it opens is:

`/lightning/setup/ManageUsers/home`

Create the user with a Salesforce Platform or Salesforce license, save, then come back to
Access and search for their name.

## Common mistakes

**You cannot find the person in the search box.** The search only shows active users. If
you just created the user, check that you saved it and that the Active checkbox is ticked.
If someone has left and you deactivated them, their name will not appear here, which is
correct: a deactivated user cannot sign in at all, so there is no role to remove.

**You gave someone a role and they still cannot see anything.** A role controls what a
person can do inside Open Impact. It does not sign them in. Check that the person has a
Salesforce license in Setup, and that they are opening the Nonprofit Hub app rather than
another app. If they see the app but no records, the records may be private and simply
owned by someone else, which is a sharing setting rather than a role.

**You see "This role is still being prepared. Wait a moment, reload the page, and try
again."** Salesforce rebuilds a role in the background whenever it changes, for example
just after the package is installed or upgraded, and it cannot hand the role out while that
rebuild is running. It usually finishes in under a minute. If you still see the message
after ten minutes, open the Error Log tile on the Hub home page and send what it says with
your support request.

**You edited one of the shipped roles in Setup and now an upgrade has undone your change.**
The five roles ship with the package and are replaced on every upgrade, so any change you
make to them is lost. That is deliberate: it is what keeps the roles correct for you. If
your organization needs something extra, create your own permission set in Setup for just
that extra piece and assign it alongside the role. Your own permission sets are never
touched by an upgrade.

**You removed the Nonprofit Admin role from yourself.** The page will not let you remove
the last person holding Nonprofit Admin, and it warns you before you remove that role from
your own account. If you lose it anyway, anyone else with the Nonprofit Admin role, or a
Salesforce System Administrator working in Setup, can give it back to you.
