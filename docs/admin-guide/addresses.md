# Addresses

## What It Does

Addresses gives every household, organization, and person one place to keep all of the
places they receive mail, instead of a single set of address boxes that gets overwritten
every time someone moves. One address is marked the primary, and BarnCRM copies that
one into the standard address boxes on the household, the organization, or the person, so
mail merges, reports, letter templates, and any other app you use keep reading the address
they have always read.

Because the addresses are kept as records, a household can hold a winter address alongside
its year round one, an old address stays on file so a mailing sent last year can still be
explained, and one person can have an address of their own without moving the rest of
their household.

In an org that stores people as person accounts, a person saved with a mailing address, or
whose mailing address is changed afterwards, also gets an address of their own (type Home,
marked primary), and an address that is already on file for them, with the same words, is not
added a second time. This is the same as it is for a person held as a contact, except that a
person account never moves a household: the address is theirs alone.

A winter address does not have to be moved by hand. A **seasonal** address carries the dates
it is used, and a nightly job makes it the address in use on the day its season starts and
puts the previous address back on the day the season ends. The job records when it last ran
and what it did, in two places you can see without leaving the app: the BarnCRM home
page and the Addresses page of BarnCRM Settings. A nightly job you cannot see is a nightly
job you cannot trust, which is why the last run is shown rather than assumed.

## How to Turn It On

Addresses is part of Core, but on a new install it is off until you turn it on. In
**BarnCRM Settings**, **General**, choose **Turn On** in the **Addresses** row (or leave it
ticked in first-run setup); see [BarnCRM Settings](barncrm-settings.md). There is nothing to
install and no Setup step. Once it is on, two things are worth setting once.

1. Open the **BarnCRM Admin** app and choose **BarnCRM Settings**.
2. In the left navigation choose **Addresses**.
3. Set **Address Updates** to the behavior your organization wants. It always shows one of
   these three; a new install shows the first.
   - **Everyone in the household moves together** (the default): editing one person's
     address moves the whole household, which is what most organizations want, because a
     household shares a mailbox.
   - **Only that person moves**: editing one person's address gives that person an
     address of their own and leaves the rest of the household where it is. A change to the
     household's own address still reaches everyone in it who has no address of their own.
     Choose this if you often track students away at school, adult children at a parent's
     household, or staff contacts who move without their family.
   - **Nobody moves until you choose**: editing one person's address gives that person an
     address of their own, as above, and a change to the household's address (a new primary
     on its card, an edit to its billing address) changes the household only. Its people keep
     their mailing address until you choose **Give This Address to Members** from the **More**
     menu of the household's primary address (see "Moving a household on purpose" below). The seasonal swap is
     the one exception: it still moves everyone in the household who has no address of their
     own, because the dates were chosen in advance. Choose this if your team checks every
     move before a mailing goes out.
4. Choose **Save**. The change applies to the next address you edit.

**Addresses of deleted records** (on the same page) says what happens to a household's,
organization's or person's addresses when it is deleted (D-184). It always shows one of these
two; a new install shows the first.

- **Delete their addresses** (the default): the addresses go to the Recycle Bin with the
  record, and come back, linked to it again, when you restore it. Each address belongs to one
  household, organization or person, so no one else's address is touched. Deleting a
  household whose people are its contacts deletes those people too, and their addresses go
  with them. A merge is not a delete: the addresses move to the record you keep.
- **Keep their addresses**: the addresses stay on file, belonging to nobody, as they did
  before this setting. Restoring the record does not link them again.

BarnCRM's own clean-ups (the nightly tidy-up of empty households, and erasing a person) delete
the addresses whichever you choose. The work is done by two automations on the
**Automation** page, **Addresses of a deleted person** and **Addresses of a deleted account**;
switching one off keeps the addresses as **Keep their addresses** does.

Then turn on the seasonal address swap, which is off until you turn it on.

5. Stay on the **Addresses** page and tick **Turn on seasonal addresses**, then choose **Save**.
   BarnCRM schedules the nightly job for you: there is no separate button to press.
6. Under **Seasonal Address Swap** the message now reads "The swap runs every night at
   12:30 AM, in your organization's time zone" and the date of the next run appears under it.
   Before you turned the switch on, it read "Seasonal Addresses is off, so seasonal
   addresses will not move on their own."
7. Choose **Run the Swap Now** once, so you do not have to wait until tomorrow to see that it
   works. Refresh the page after a minute: **Seasonal Addresses Last Swapped** shows the time
   it finished and a sentence saying how many addresses moved.

Saving the **Turn on seasonal addresses** box again when the job is already scheduled changes nothing, so
the job is never scheduled twice. Untick it and choose **Save** to stop the job. **Run the
swap now** works whether the switch is on or off.

You need the **Manage BarnCRM Settings** permission, which the BarnCRM Admin access level
gives you, to save the switch or to use **Run the Swap Now**. Everyone else sees the same
last run and cannot change either.

There is nothing to do in Setup. Scheduling Apex is normally a Setup task, and BarnCRM
does not ask you to do that: the **Turn on seasonal addresses** switch is the supported way to
schedule the swap. The Module Manager switches whole modules on and off; the seasonal swap
belongs to Core, which is always on, so it is scheduled here. If your organization already
ran the nightly swap before this switch existed, the upgrade turns the switch on for you and
the job carries on as it was.

Two things to know about the schedule.

- **If you turn the switch off, nothing moves back.** Addresses stay exactly where the last run
  put them. If you turn it off in February, the household stays at its winter address until
  you turn it on again or move the address yourself.
- **Whoever turns the switch on should be an administrator.** The swap itself sees every
  address in the org, but the copy of the new address into the standard address boxes runs as
  the person who saved the switch. If that person cannot edit a household, that household's
  swap is written to the Error Log instead of going through quietly.

To let your team see and manage addresses, make sure they have one of the packaged access
levels (BarnCRM Admin or Team Member, or Fundraising Staff with
Giving) on the **Access** page in
BarnCRM Settings. Read Only users can see addresses and cannot change them: the Addresses
card shows them no **Add Address** or **Set as Primary** button.

Addresses appear in two places once you are set up: an **Addresses** card on every
household, organization, and person record, and an **Addresses** tab in the BarnCRM
app for reporting and list views.

The card reads and saves addresses as the person using it, through Salesforce's own record
service, so it shows exactly what their object and field access allows and nothing more. An
address edited elsewhere on the page shows on the card without a reload, and after **Set as
Primary** the record's own address boxes refresh too.

## A Five-Minute Walkthrough

You are Maria. The Garcia household spends January to March in Arizona and the rest of the
year at home, and letters have been going to the wrong place. Start from the sample data.

1. Open the **BarnCRM** app and choose **Households**. Open **The Garcia Family**.
2. Scroll to the **Addresses** card. You will see one address already there, of type
   **Home**, with a **Primary** badge on it. BarnCRM created it from the address that
   was already in the household's standard address boxes when the household was created,
   so nothing you had was lost.
3. Choose **Add Address** on the card. Fill in:
   - **Type**: Seasonal
   - **Street**: 4120 East Camelback Road
   - **City**: Phoenix
   - **State**: AZ
   - **Postal Code**: 85018
   - **Country**: United States
   - **Seasonal Start Month**: 1, **Seasonal Start Day**: 1
   - **Seasonal End Month**: 3, **Seasonal End Day**: 31
   Choose **Add Address** in the form (it carries the same name as the button that opened
   it). The new card appears with its dates shown as "January 1 to March 31".
4. Choose **Set as Primary** on the Arizona card. The **Primary** badge moves to it, and
   the badge disappears from the home address. Scroll up: the household's address boxes at
   the top of the record now read Phoenix. Anything that reads the household's address,
   including a mail merge or a report, now gets Arizona.
5. Choose **Set as Primary** on the home address card to move the badge back. The
   household's address boxes read the home address again. Nothing was deleted: both
   addresses are still on the card, and you can move the primary between them whenever you
   like.
6. Open **Harper Garcia**, one of the household's members, from the household's related
   people. Change her **Mailing Street** to a new street and save.
7. Go back to **The Garcia Family**. Because your setting says **Everyone in the household moves together**, the
   household's primary address now shows Harper's new street, and every other member of the
   household has the same new mailing address. One edit moved the whole household, which is
   what a household moving actually means. The new street is a new Home address card marked
   primary; the address it replaced stays on the card as history and is not overwritten. If
   the household is away for the season when you make the edit, the seasonal address card is
   left as it is, and the new street is the one the household comes back to.

If you had set **Only that person moves** instead, step 7 would look different: Harper
would have her own address card on her own record, marked primary for her, and the rest of
the
Garcia household would still be at the old street. Both behaviors are correct; they are
just different organizations. From then on Harper keeps her own address when the household
moves, by any route: a new primary on the household's card, an edit to its billing address,
or the seasonal swap.

Editing the household's own **Billing Address** works the same way as step 6. Change the
street on **The Garcia Family** and save: the new street becomes a new Home address card
marked primary, the old one stays as history, and every member without an address of their
own gets the new mailing address.

## Moving a Household on Purpose

Two choices in an address's **More** menu on the **Addresses** card move a household when you
decide to, whatever **Address Updates** is set to. They need the same access as **Set as
Primary**: edit on addresses, and on the household and its people. Nothing is deleted: the
address each one replaces stays on the card as history.

- **Move the Household Here**, on a person's own address (not a seasonal one). The
  household gets a new primary address copied from this one, and everyone in it who has no
  address of their own moves to it. The person stops having an address of their own in use
  (their cards stay, as history), so from now on they move with the household. In the
  flexible way of belonging, if they are a current member of more than one household the
  confirmation asks which, their own household first; choosing another household moves that household
  and leaves the person's own address in use.
- **Give This Address to Members**, on the household's primary address. A confirmation lists
  who will get this address (everyone in the household with no address of their own) and who
  has an address of their own. Those are left where they are unless you tick them; a ticked
  person stops having an address of their own in use and gets the household's address. Choose
  **Give This Address to Members** in the confirmation to go ahead, or **Cancel**. In the flexible
  way of belonging, a person whose own household is another one is not listed.

Neither move reaches someone marked **Deceased**: they are not moved and not listed. When
two people in the list share a name, each shows their birthdate, for example "Sam Lee (born
4/2/1961)", or their email when there is no birthdate, so you can tell them apart.

Both confirmations open in a dialog over the page, so nothing on the card moves while you
decide; **Escape** or **Cancel** closes it with nothing changed.

With **Nobody moves until you choose**, **Give This Address to Members** is how a household's
new address reaches its people. In the other two settings it is how you bring someone with an
address of their own back to the household's address.

## Address History

Every address has a **Status** (**Current**, **Former** or **Undeliverable**), a **Start Date**
and an **End Date**, so the card can tell where someone lives now from where they used to.

**A move fills them in for you.** When a new address is added as the primary and it is a
different place from the primary it replaces, the old one gets today as its **End Date** and
becomes **Former**, and the new one gets today as its **Start Date**. That happens however the
new primary arrives: added on the card with **Primary** ticked, typed into the household's
billing address or a person's mailing address, **Move the Household Here**, or an import. A
person whose own address **Move the Household Here** or **Give This Address to Members** stops
using is ended the same way, unless the household's address is the same place. BarnCRM keeps
these dates and the status itself, so a person whose access to addresses does not include the
three fields (for example access from a profile, without a BarnCRM permission set) still saves
addresses, and their moves are still recorded.

**Today is your organization's date.** Every BarnCRM date rule (a move's dates, the seasonal
swap, whether a membership has ended) reads today in your organization's default time zone
(Setup, **Company Information**), not in the time zone of the person saving. So two colleagues
in different time zones always get the same answer, even late in the evening.

**These are not moves, and end nothing:** **Set as Primary** on an address already on the card
(a household with a home and a work address can switch between them), the nightly seasonal swap,
the address put in use when a primary is deleted, and a merge. A seasonal address is never
ended by a move: if a household moves while its winter address is the primary, the home it
left is the one that becomes **Former**, and it still goes to the winter address next year.

**Undeliverable is your call.** Staff mark an address **Undeliverable** from its card (the
status menu) when mail comes back; BarnCRM never sets or clears it. An undeliverable primary
address is flagged in red on the card, and the **Primary Addresses Marked Undeliverable** check
in **Org Optimizer**, **Data Quality** lists every household, organization and person whose
primary is marked that way, with **Open in Find** (see [Data Quality](data-hygiene.md)).

**A Former address stays out of use.** The seasonal swap skips a **Former** seasonal address
(the household no longer winters there) and never puts a **Former** address back when a season
ends; after a primary is deleted, a **Former** address is chosen only when nothing else is
left. Choosing **Set as Primary** on a **Former** address makes it **Current** again and clears
its end date.

**Addresses you already have are not rewritten.** An address saved before statuses existed has
no status, and BarnCRM reads that as **Current**; it is filled in the next time the address is
saved. Nothing records which old address a household actually left, so BarnCRM does not guess:
mark old addresses **Former** from the card when you know.

On the card, the addresses in use come first, the primary at the top, each with the day it
started when that is known. Below them, **Former Addresses** is a closed group, holding every
**Former** address and any address whose end date has passed, each with its dates (for
example "January 5, 2020 to October 1, 2026"). Select the group's heading to open it.

**Address Card Fields** (BarnCRM Settings, **Addresses**) adds fields of your choice to every
address on the card: tick them in the list, which holds every custom Address field, yours
included, and the address number. Nothing is ticked on a new install, so the card shows only
its usual fields. A field someone cannot see is left out for them, and a field the card
already shows is not repeated.

**How the card looks.** The addresses are a list divided by lines. Each line has the address
icon, its type (a link to the address record) and its badges (**Primary** with a star,
**Undeliverable** in red) at the top with the **More** menu at the right, the address under
them, and **Set as Primary** below. **More** holds **Edit** (the standard edit form), the
status choices, and the household move the address allows. Former addresses sit on shaded
lines. A record with no address yet shows **No Addresses Yet** with an **Add Address** button.

## A Five-Minute Walkthrough for the Seasonal Swap

Still the Garcia household, and still five minutes. This time you are proving to yourself
that the nightly job really works, before the winter mailing goes out.

1. Open **BarnCRM Settings** and choose **Addresses**. If **Turn on seasonal addresses** is not
   ticked, tick it and choose **Save**.
2. Open **The Garcia Family** and look at the **Addresses** card. The Arizona address you
   added is of type **Seasonal** and reads "Used from January 1 to March 31". The **Primary**
   badge is on the home address.
3. Change the Arizona address's dates so that today falls inside them: set **Seasonal Start
   Month** and **Seasonal Start Day** to yesterday's month and day, and the end month and day
   to a date next month. Save.
4. Go back to **BarnCRM Settings**, **Addresses**, and choose **Run the Swap Now**.
5. Wait a minute and refresh the page. **Seasonal Addresses Last Swapped** now shows a time a
   minute ago and reads "1 moved to a seasonal address, 0 moved back, 0 could not be changed."
6. Open **The Garcia Family** again. The **Primary** badge is on the Arizona address, the
   household's address boxes at the top of the record read Phoenix, and every member of the
   household has Phoenix as their mailing address (except anyone with an address of their
   own: see "Expecting everyone in a household to move with it" below). Nobody typed any of
   that.
7. Now set the Arizona address's end date to yesterday, save, and choose **Run the Swap Now**
   again. The summary reads "0 moved to a seasonal address, 1 moved back", the badge is back
   on the home address, and the household's address boxes read Springfield again.
8. Open the **BarnCRM** home page. The **Seasonal Addresses Last Swapped** tile shows
   the same time and the same sentence. That tile is where you will notice, on an ordinary
   morning, if the job has stopped running.

A range that crosses New Year works the same way and is entered as one range. November 1 to
March 31 means the household is in Arizona on November 1, on Christmas Day, and on March 31,
and back home on April 1. Do not split it into two addresses.

## Common Mistakes

**Editing the standard address boxes directly.** BarnCRM treats the address records as the
truth and copies the primary into the standard address boxes, but an edit typed into the
boxes is not lost. A new billing address on a household or an organization, typed on the
page or written by a data loader, an import or an integration, becomes a new primary address
of type Home (Work for an organization), and the household's members move with it, the same
as when the household was created with that address (unless **Address Updates** is **Nobody
moves until you choose**). The address it replaced stays on the card as history. A person's
new mailing address follows the **Address Updates** setting. Emptying the billing address changes nothing on the card, and a household
that Nonprofit Cloud manages is left alone. Prefer the address card all the same: a cleanup
that rewrites every household's billing address adds an address record to each household it
changes. This is also why address verification apps should be pointed at the address
records.

**Expecting everyone in a household to move with it.** A household's address reaches every
current member except two kinds of person, who keep the address they have: a person who has
a primary address of their own (one on their own **Addresses** card, such as **Only that
person moves** gives them), and, in the flexible way of belonging, a person for whom this is
not their household (their household is the one they are the primary member of, else the
one they joined first). They stay put when the household's primary changes, when its billing
address is edited, and when the seasonal swap moves it. This is how a student stays at their
dorm, or an adult child at their own home, while the rest of the household moves. To bring a
person back to the household's address, choose **Give This Address to Members** on the
household's primary address and tick them; see "Moving a household on purpose". With
**Address Updates** set to **Nobody moves until you choose**, a household change reaches
nobody until you choose it, except the seasonal swap.

**Typing a state or country as a code in an org with State and Country Picklists.** With the
picklists on, the standard address boxes take a full name ("Illinois", "United States") as
text. BarnCRM copies a code typed on an address card ("IL", "US") into the code fields instead,
so the copy is saved and the boxes show the full names. A state code is used only when the
country is filled in too, because the same code means different states in different countries:
an address with a state code and no country is refused by Salesforce. Fill in the country, or
type the state's full name.

**Marking two addresses as primary.** You cannot end up with two. Marking a second address
as the primary clears the first one automatically, and when one save (an import, say) marks
two addresses of the same household or person as primary, the last of them is kept and the
others are saved unmarked. If you expected both to stay marked, you wanted two addresses
with different types (for example Home and Work), not two primary addresses.

**Unticking Primary on the address in use.** Refused, with "This is the address in use. To
change that, make another address the primary, or delete this one." A household or person
is never left with no address in use while their standard address boxes still show the old
one. Choose **Set as Primary** on the address you want instead.

**The first address on a record.** The first address you add from the address card to a
household, organization or person with none is saved as the primary, so it is in use straight
away. After that, a new address is added unmarked until you choose **Set as Primary**.

**Two primary addresses just after a merge.** When Salesforce's own merge combines two records that
each had a primary address, the kept record briefly has both. Within a minute or so BarnCRM
keeps one: the one that matches the kept record's address boxes (billing for a household or
organization, mailing for a contact or a person account), or else the most recently created. The other stays on
the card as an ordinary address. This runs in the background because Salesforce does not let
anything change records while it is merging them.

**Filling in a seasonal address with no dates.** A Seasonal address needs all four date
boxes: start month, start day, end month, end day. Saving without them gives you
"A seasonal address needs a start month, a start day, an end month, and an end day so we
know when to use it." The day must be one its month has (April 31 is refused; February 29
is accepted). Fill in the four boxes, or change the type to Other if the address is
not really seasonal. A range that crosses New Year, such as November 1 to March 31, is one
range: enter it exactly that way, do not split it into two addresses.

**Putting an organization or another household in a household.** In an org that stores
people as person accounts, an address is copied into a household member's own mailing boxes.
A member that is not a person, for example an organization record that has been added to a
household by mistake, has no mailing boxes to copy into, so BarnCRM skips it and copies
the address to everyone else. The address still saves. If someone should have received the
address and did not, check that they are a person rather than an organization.

**Choosing more than one owner for an address.** An address belongs to a household, to an
organization, or to one person, never to two at once. If you fill in both a household and a
person you get "An address belongs to one household, one organization, or one person.
Choose only one." Clear the one you did not mean. If you want a person to have their own
address inside a household, put the person on it and leave the household blank.

**Deleting the primary address.** You can delete it, and BarnCRM promotes the most
recently created remaining address to primary so the household is never left with no
address in its standard boxes. An address that is not seasonal is preferred: a seasonal one
is promoted only when nothing else is left, so mail does not go to a winter home in July. If
the household has only one address, deleting it leaves the standard address boxes as they
were and nothing is promoted. Prefer adding a new
address and marking it primary over deleting the old one: the old address is the record of
where a mailing actually went.

**Expecting the swap to happen without turning it on.** Entering seasonal dates is not enough:
**Turn on seasonal addresses** has to be ticked and saved once, on the Addresses page of BarnCRM
Settings, which schedules the nightly job. Until you do that, the page says so in as many
words and the home page tile says the swap has not run. If
the tile ever says the swap is scheduled but has not run in more than 36 hours, choose
**Run the Swap Now** and check the Error Log.

**Two seasonal addresses covering the same day.** If a household has a November to March
address and a December to February address, both cover Christmas. BarnCRM uses the one
that was added first, so the answer does not change from night to night, and writes a warning
to the Error Log naming the address. Fix the dates so that only one seasonal address covers
each day.

**Wondering what the Replaced By Seasonal box means.** It is how the job remembers which
address to put back in the spring, and you will see it ticked on the home address of a
household that is away for the season. It is set and cleared by the job and is read only on
the address record, so there is nothing for you to do with it. If it is ever missing when a
season ends, the job falls back to the most recently created address that is not seasonal,
which is usually the same address anyway.

**Deleting the address a season replaced.** The seasonal address stays in use and there is
nothing to put back when the season ends, unless the household has another address that is not
seasonal. Add the new year round address before deleting the old one, and the swap will find
it.
