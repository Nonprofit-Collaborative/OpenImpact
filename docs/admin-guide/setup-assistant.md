# Setup Assistant

## What it does

The Setup Assistant is the guided path from "I just installed Open Impact" to "we are
entering real gifts", in under thirty minutes, without opening Salesforce Setup and without
reading anything else. It asks you eight questions, one screen at a time, in the order that
makes each answer easy, and it remembers where you got to. Close the browser in the middle
of step four and come back tomorrow: the assistant opens on step four.

Nothing it asks is permanent. Every answer is a setting you can change later on the
Nonprofit Settings page, and you can re-run the whole assistant whenever your organization
changes.

## How to turn it on

There is nothing to turn on. The Setup Assistant is the Nonprofit Hub home page until you
finish it.

1. Click the app launcher (the grid of dots at the top left of Salesforce).
2. Type `Nonprofit` and choose **Nonprofit Hub**.
3. The home page opens on the assistant, at the first step you have not finished.

When every step is done, the assistant collapses to a small **Setup complete** tile that
shows how many steps you finished. The tile has a **Reopen setup** button, so the assistant
is always one click away, and it opens straight back on the first step rather than on the
completion screen.

You need the **Manage Nonprofit Settings** permission to change anything in the assistant.
Everyone else sees the same steps, reads the same explanations, and cannot save. If you can
read but not save, the assistant says so at the top and names the permission you are
missing. Ask whoever installed Open Impact to add you to the **Nonprofit Admin** role on
the Access page.

Two things sit outside the assistant, because Salesforce does not let an app do them:

- **Creating a Salesforce user** who has never signed in. Step four links you to the Setup
  page that does it, then you come back and give the new person a role.
- **Installing another Open Impact module.** Step six tells you which modules are present
  and links to the install instructions for the rest.

## A five-minute walkthrough, and then the eight steps

Maria has just installed Open Impact Core in her organization's Nonprofit Cloud org. That
org has Person Accounts turned on, which matters in step one and nowhere else. She has half
an hour before her next meeting.

### Before you start

Have these to hand. Every one of them is optional, and every one of them is faster to have
ready than to go and find:

- Your organization's legal name as it appears on your tax filings.
- Your tax identification number (in the United States, your EIN).
- Your mailing address as you want it printed on a receipt.
- Your logo, as a PNG or JPG file.
- A scan of the signature that goes on receipt letters, if you use one.

### Step 1: Confirm how Open Impact fits your org

Open Impact looks at your org and tells you what it found, in plain words:

- **"Your org uses Person Accounts, as Nonprofit Cloud orgs do."** This is Maria's case.
  Open Impact recommends **Agentforce Nonprofit coexistence**: households are tracked with
  a membership record for each person, so a person can belong to more than one household
  and nothing you already have is disturbed. Your existing records keep working exactly as
  they do today. Confirming this mode switches household membership to those membership
  records, and from then on saving a new person creates their household and their
  membership of it, exactly as it does in the simple mode. The switch that governs that is
  "create a household automatically" on the Households page of Nonprofit Settings.
- **"NPSP is installed in this org."** Open Impact recommends **NPSP coexistence**, which
  records that NPSP is here. In this version it changes no behaviour: Open Impact builds its
  own households and leaves NPSP's alone.
- **"This looks like a fresh org."** Open Impact recommends **Standalone**, the simplest
  arrangement.

Read the recommendation, then click **Confirm and continue**. If you know something the
detection cannot see, choose a different mode from the list first and then confirm.

**What Maria sees:** the sentence about Person Accounts, the recommended mode already
selected, and one button. She clicks it. Two seconds.

**What she decides:** nothing, unless she disagrees with the detection.

### Step 2: Confirm how households are named

The assistant opens the household naming settings inside the step, with the live preview.
Choose the pattern for the household name, the formal greeting, and the informal greeting,
and watch five sample households, which ship with the product, change as you type.

Click **Save**, and the step completes itself. If your org does not have the household
naming screen yet, the step says so and tells you that Open Impact will name households
with the pattern it ships until you change it.

**What Maria sees:** `The Smith Family`, `Mr. and Mrs. John Smith`, `John and Jane`. She
tries `Smith Household` in the name box, sees it in the preview, decides she prefers the
default, and puts it back.

**What she decides:** whether her donors are a Family or a Household. That is genuinely the
whole decision.

### Step 3: Pick your default fund and appeal

This step needs the **Giving** module, which is a separate package.

- **If Giving is installed**, you get two pickers: the fund a gift belongs to when nobody
  says otherwise (usually your general operating fund) and the appeal it is credited to
  (usually a general or unsolicited appeal). Choose them and click **Save**. The pickers
  only offer real funds and appeals, and anything else is refused, so a default can never
  point at the wrong kind of record.
- **If Giving is not installed**, the step says **Install the Giving module to choose
  defaults** and offers **Skip for now**. Skipping does not mark the step done, so it is
  waiting for you after you install Giving.

**What Maria sees:** the install notice, because she has only installed Core so far. She
clicks **Skip for now** and moves on.

**What she decides:** to come back to this one.

### Step 4: Give your colleagues access

Pick one person, pick a role, and click **Give access**. The step confirms with "Access
given. Add another person, or continue.", and the person box clears so you can do the next
one. Give access to as many colleagues as you like, one at a time. The roles are:

| Role | Who it is for |
|---|---|
| Nonprofit Admin | Maria: everything, including settings |
| Fundraising Staff | David: gifts, donors, receipts |
| Program Staff | Priya: participants and services |
| Volunteer Coordinator | Volunteer jobs, shifts, and hours |
| Read Only | Tom and Jen: see everything, change nothing |

The person has to exist as a Salesforce user first. If someone is missing from the list,
click **Create a user in Setup**, create them there, come back, and refresh the step.

**What Maria sees:** her four colleagues in the picker. She gives David the Fundraising
Staff role and Tom the Read Only role. The step marks itself done.

**What she decides:** who gets to change settings. Give that to as few people as the work
allows: settings change how the whole org behaves.

### Step 5: Set your organization's identity for receipts

This is the form the "before you start" list was for. Fill in:

- **Legal name**, exactly as on your tax filings, not your nickname.
- **Tax identification number** (EIN in the United States).
- **Address**, on one line, as you want it printed.
- **Logo**: click **Upload logo** and choose the file. The logo appears under the button
  once it has uploaded, so you can see what your receipts will carry.
- **Signature image**: the same, for the scanned signature on receipt letters.
- **Signer name and title**, for example `Ana Ruiz` and `Executive Director`.

Click **Save**. The step completes when the legal name is filled in, because that is the
one a receipt cannot be printed without.

Two things to know about the uploaded files. They are stored as Salesforce files owned by
whoever uploads them, and they are attached to that person's user record, because
Salesforce requires an uploaded file to be attached to a record and there is no better
record to attach a logo to. Two consequences: keep the person who uploads the logo as an
active user, and if the logo needs to change, upload the new one rather than editing the
old file.

**What Maria sees:** five boxes, two upload buttons, and the logo and signature themselves
once they are uploaded. The tax identification number box says what one looks like
(`12-3456789`) and tells her to leave it blank outside the United States.

**What she decides:** which name is the legal one. If you have a "doing business as" name,
the legal name goes here and your everyday name goes on the letter text later.

### Step 6: Choose which modules to turn on

A list of the six Open Impact packages: Core, Giving, Volunteers, Programs, Funders, and
Connect. Each says **Present** or **Not installed**, with a link to what it does.

Core is always present. The rest are separate packages, and a module that is not installed
leaves nothing behind in your org: no objects, no tabs, no automation. Installing one means
opening its install link and following the Salesforce install screens, which is why the
assistant links to instructions rather than doing it for you.

The one-click **Turn on** and **Turn off** actions arrive with the Module Manager in
version 0.7. Until then this step is a truthful inventory and a set of links.

Click **Next** when you have read it. The step marks itself done.

**What Maria sees:** Core present, everything else not installed. She makes a note to
install Giving this afternoon.

### Step 7: Bring in your data

Two buttons, and you may use either, both, or neither:

- **Load the sample data** puts about two hundred realistic households, people, and
  organizations in your org so you can practise on something that is not your real data.
  You can remove it again from the same panel.
- **Import a spreadsheet** opens the Import tab, where you upload your file, map your
  columns, run a dry run, and see what would happen before anything is created.

If the Import tab is not in your org yet, the step says so rather than sending you to a
page that does not exist, and the same is true of the sample data loader.

**What Maria sees:** both buttons. She loads the sample data, because her real export is
still being cleaned up.

**What she decides:** practise first, or go straight to the real thing. Practise first.

### Step 8: Check that everything works

If the Giving module is installed, **Enter your first gift** opens the Giving module's own
gift entry screen: enter one gift, save it, and you have proved the whole chain works, from
donor to household to gift. Come back to the Hub afterwards and click **Finish**.

If Giving is not installed yet, the step shows a **You are ready** summary of what you
configured, and says that the first gift check is waiting for Giving.

Click **Finish**. The assistant shows the completion screen: every step with its status,
and how long setup took, measured from the first change you made.

**What Maria sees:** "You are ready", her eight steps, and `21 minutes`. Two buttons sit
under the summary: **Reopen setup** walks the steps again with her answers intact, and
**Start setup again** forgets the progress it recorded so the checklist starts from the
first step. Neither of them empties a setting: a step whose answer is already saved stays
finished, because it is.

## Common mistakes

- **Treating Skip for now as done.** Skipping moves you on without marking the step
  finished, on purpose. A skipped step still shows as **To do**, and the next time you open
  the Hub the assistant opens on it again. That is the point: step three is meant to wait
  until Giving is installed.
- **Marking coexistence mode and then changing your mind quietly.** Changing the mode later
  is allowed and is a real change: it changes how household membership is tracked from that
  point on. Change it on the Nonprofit Settings page, read the note there first, and do it
  before you import, not after.
- **Uploading the logo from a colleague's login, then deactivating them.** The file belongs
  to the person who uploaded it. Upload the logo and the signature from an account that
  will stay active, ideally the administrator's.
- **Putting the everyday name in the legal name box.** Receipts have to carry the name your
  tax filings carry. If they differ, the legal name goes in step five.
- **Expecting the assistant to install Giving.** No app can install another package for
  you. Step three and step six give you the link and the instructions, and detect the
  module the moment you come back.
- **Re-running setup to fix one thing.** You do not have to. Every answer is on the
  Nonprofit Settings page, grouped by section, with a search box. Reopen the assistant when
  something big changes, such as a new fiscal year or a merger, not to correct a typo.
