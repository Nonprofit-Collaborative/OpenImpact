# The BarnCRM Apps and Navigation

## What It Does

BarnCRM Core comes as four apps: two for everyday work and two for administrators, each in
standard navigation and console navigation.

| App | For | Navigation | Tabs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BarnCRM** | Everyone with a BarnCRM role | Standard: each record opens in place of the page | Home, Contacts, Households, Organizations, Data Manager |
| **BarnCRM Console** | Everyone with a BarnCRM role | Console: records stay open side by side in tabs | Home, Contacts, Households, Organizations, Addresses, Relationships, Affiliations, Household Members, Data Manager |
| **BarnCRM Admin** | The BarnCRM Admin role only | Standard | BarnCRM Settings, Data Manager, Org Optimizer, Duplicate Matching, Automation, Error Log |
| **BarnCRM Admin Console** | The BarnCRM Admin role only | Console | The same as BarnCRM Admin |

The everyday apps give you one home page that tells you what to do next, a setup checklist
that remembers how far you got, and the places you go most: your households, your people and
your organizations. The admin apps hold every BarnCRM tool and setting in one place. Each
tab shows only to the people whose access allows it, so a menu can be shorter than the list.
**Super Importer**, **Find** and **Super Transformer** are not in any app's navigation: open them from the
tiles on the **Data Manager** tab, which also has tiles for **Org Optimizer** and **Duplicate
Matching**. The raw **Import Rows** tab is in no app's navigation either: open it from an
import's results in Super Importer, or from the App Launcher. **Error Log** is always the last tab of an app that has it,
after any pages a module adds. In the everyday apps, **Data Manager** is the last Core tab and
a module's pages follow it.

Each page's icon matches what it does, and the page header and its console tab show the same
one: a gear for **BarnCRM Settings**, building blocks for **Data Manager**, a stethoscope for
**Org Optimizer**, scales for **Duplicate Matching**, a factory for **Automation**, a bell
for **Error Log**, a telescope for
**Find** and a form for **Import**. **Households** show people, **Organizations** a building,
**Addresses** a map. On Data Manager, Org Optimizer, Duplicate Matching, Find and Import the
page name appears once, in the page header, and the tool below it starts with what it is for.

Module tabs follow the same rule: every Giving, Volunteers, Programs, Logic Models, Rollup
Builder and Mirror tab has its own icon, never one shared with another BarnCRM tab (for
example a stack of cash for **Gifts**, a trophy for **Donor Levels**, a chalkboard for **Logic
Models**, a sailboat for **Programs**). The full list is in the contributor guide's
[Tab Icons](../contributor-guide/tab-icons.md).

If you have ever installed something in Salesforce and then wondered where to start, this
is the answer to that question. You start in **BarnCRM** (or **BarnCRM Console**).

### Where Everything Is

| What you are looking for | Where it is |
|---|---|
| People, households, organizations | **BarnCRM** or **BarnCRM Console** |
| Find, Import and Super Transformer | The **Data Manager** tab, in any BarnCRM app |
| Setup checklist, Health Check, What's new | The **Home** tab of **BarnCRM** or **BarnCRM Console** |
| BarnCRM Settings, Access, Module Manager, Features | **BarnCRM Settings** tab in **BarnCRM Admin** or **BarnCRM Admin Console** |
| Org Optimizer, Duplicate Matching, Automation, Error Log | **BarnCRM Admin** or **BarnCRM Admin Console** |
| Record Inspector | The **Inspect This Record** button at the top of the right column on Contact and Account pages (it has no tab in the apps, D-183) |
| Rollup Builder (Rollup Builder module) | **BarnCRM Admin** or **BarnCRM Admin Console** |
| Gifts and everything around them (Giving module) | The **BarnCRM Fundraising** app, and the BarnCRM apps once added (below) |
| Volunteer shifts and hours (Volunteers module) | The **BarnCRM Volunteers** app, and the BarnCRM apps once added (below) |
| Forms and form submissions (Forms module) | The **BarnCRM Forms** app, and **BarnCRM** or **BarnCRM Console** |
| Events, speakers and venues (Event Management module) | The **BarnCRM Events** app, and **BarnCRM** or **BarnCRM Console** |
| Portals (Portal Builder module) | The **BarnCRM Portal Builder** app, and **BarnCRM Admin** or **BarnCRM Admin Console** |
| Library, compliance, agreements and boards (Corporate Hub module) | The **BarnCRM Corporate Hub** app, and **BarnCRM** or **BarnCRM Console** |
| Projects, time and expenses (Project Management module) | The **BarnCRM Projects** app, and **BarnCRM** or **BarnCRM Console** |

The home page's **Modules** list names each installed module, marked **On** or **Off** (turned
off in BarnCRM Settings, Modules), with an **Open the App** link for a module that has an app
of its own. Rollup Builder, Mirror and the smaller modules have no app of their own: their
pages are in the BarnCRM apps.

### The Module Apps

Each module app is a console app with the module's own logo, every page of the module,
**Reports**, and **Error Log** last. The module's permission sets show the app, so whoever has
the module's Staff, Admin or Read Only set (Portal Builder: its Admin set) sees it in the App
Launcher.

| App | Pages |
|---|---|
| **BarnCRM Events** | Events Home, Event Calendar, Events, Event Speakers, Venues, Reports, Error Log |
| **BarnCRM Forms** | Forms, Form Submissions, Reports, Error Log |
| **BarnCRM Portal Builder** | Portals, Portal Accesses, Reports, Error Log |
| **BarnCRM Corporate Hub** | Corporate Hub, Library Documents, Compliance Obligations, Agreements, Boards and Committees, Board Meetings, Processing Activities, Data Subject Requests, Data Breaches, Reports, Dashboards, Error Log |
| **BarnCRM Projects** | Projects Home, Timesheet, Approvals, Requests, Projects, Time Entries, Project Expenses, Project Resources, Staffing, Project Rates, Project Invoices, Request Connections, Reports, Error Log |

Test and developer orgs (scratch and Developer Edition orgs) allow only about 10 custom apps, so
`scripts/org/deploy-packages.sh` leaves these five apps out of such an org; every page is still
in the BarnCRM apps there (ADR-0223). A production org or sandbox gets every app.

### A Module's Pages in the BarnCRM Apps

The modules with their own app keep it, and their pages also sit in the BarnCRM apps so you
need not switch apps. The modules with no app have their pages only here:

| Module | Added to **BarnCRM** and **BarnCRM Console** | Added to **BarnCRM Admin** and **BarnCRM Admin Console** |
|---|---|---|
| Rollup Builder | | Rollup Builder |
| Giving | Quick Gift Entry, Gifts, Commitments, Gift Batches | Accounting Periods, Donor Level Ladder, Stewardship Plan Setup, Pledge Reminders, Receipt Letters |
| Volunteers | Volunteer Shifts, Volunteer Hours | |
| Mirror | | Provider Requests |
| Mirror for Giving | | Campaign Sync, Opportunity Mirror, Accounting Export |
| Forms | Forms, Form Submissions | |
| Event Management | Events Home, Event Calendar, Events, Event Speakers, Venues | |
| Portal Builder | | Portals, Portal Accesses |
| Corporate Hub | Corporate Hub, Library Documents, Compliance Obligations, Agreements, Boards and Committees, Board Meetings | |
| Project Management | Projects Home, Timesheet, Approvals, Requests, Projects, Time Entries, Project Expenses, Project Resources, Staffing | Project Rates, Project Invoices, Request Connections |

A module's pages go after **Data Manager** in the everyday apps and before **Error Log** in
the admin apps, so Error Log stays last. A form, form submission or event opens on its own
record page from any app, since its module makes that page the org default.

- **Deployed from source** with `scripts/org/deploy-packages.sh`: the script adds the pages
  of every module it deployed itself, as its last step. Nothing to do. Each run sets the four
  apps to exactly Core's pages plus those of the modules it deployed.
- **Removing a module from a source install**: before deleting the module's components, set the
  apps back without its pages, naming only the module folders you keep (here Giving and
  Rollups):

  ```
  python3 scripts/org/module-app-tabs.py --all apps-out rollups giving
  sf project deploy start --metadata-dir apps-out --target-org myorg
  ```

  With no module left, leave the folder names out.
- **Installed as packages**: Salesforce does not let one package add its pages to another
  package's app, so you add them once by hand. **Home**, **Setup Checklist**, **Modules**
  lists the pages for each installed module. For each BarnCRM app you use:
  1. In Setup, open **App Manager** and click **Edit** next to the app.
  2. Open **Navigation Items**, move the listed pages to **Selected Items**, and click
     **Save**. Skip any page that is already there.

A page shows only to people whose access allows it, so adding a page to an everyday app does
not show it to anyone who cannot use it.

## How to Turn It On

There is nothing to turn on. The apps are installed with BarnCRM Core, and BarnCRM gives each
one to the right people itself: the everyday apps to everyone with a BarnCRM role, the admin
apps to the **BarnCRM Admin** role only. It does this through four permission sets named
**BarnCRM Auto: ... App**, which it gives and takes as roles change on the Access page and again
every hour; do not assign them by hand.

1. Click the app launcher (the grid of dots at the top left of Salesforce).
2. Type `BarnCRM` and choose **BarnCRM** or **BarnCRM Console** (an administrator also sees
   **BarnCRM Admin** and **BarnCRM Admin Console**).
3. Click the star next to the app name if you want it to open by default. Each person picks
   their own default app this way.

### Hide One Navigation Style for Everyone

By default everyone sees both styles and picks the one they like. To show only one:

1. Open **BarnCRM Settings** (in **BarnCRM Admin**) and click **General**.
2. Set **App navigation style** to **Standard navigation only** or **Console navigation only**.
   **Both (each person chooses)** is the default.
3. Click **Save**. Within a minute or two the other style's apps leave everyone's App Launcher.
   Set it back to **Both (each person chooses)** to show them again.

The setting hides the everyday app and the admin app of the other style together. Each
person can still choose their own default app in the App Launcher among the apps they see.

Everyone who has been given a BarnCRM role can open the everyday apps. The home page shows each
person what they can act on:

| Part of the home page | Who sees it |
|---|---|
| **What's New in BarnCRM**: what changed in the latest release, until you click **Dismiss** | Everyone, each person once per release |
| **Welcome to BarnCRM** and the paused automation warning | Everyone |
| **New Person** button (opens the standard new contact form; the household is made automatically) | People who can create contacts |
| **New Household** button | People who can create and edit accounts (BarnCRM makes the household for them; nobody needs the Household record type) |
| **Setup Checklist** (or the **Setup Complete** tile once it is finished) | Administrators |
| **Health Check** (a summary of its last run; the full list of findings after **Run Now**) | Administrators |
| **Errors to Review** | Administrators |
| **Rollups Last Completed** | Administrators |
| **Seasonal Addresses Last Swapped** | Administrators |
| **Modules** | Administrators |
| **Files That Arrive Regularly** | Anyone who can read import templates, and only when a file is marked as arriving regularly |
| **Quick Links**: People, Households, Organizations and Find | Everyone |
| **Import a File** quick link | Anyone who can run an import (create Import Batches) |
| Module quick links: **Enter a Gift** (Giving), **Log Hours** (Volunteers), **Enroll** (Programs, for someone who can create enrollments) | Everyone, while that module is installed and turned on in the Module Manager. Each module's links come from its row in the module catalog (`Quick_Links__c` on BarnCRM Module), never from module code |
| **BarnCRM Settings** quick link | Administrators |

"Administrators" means anyone with the **Manage BarnCRM Settings** permission, which the
**BarnCRM Admin** role carries. Staff without it see a shorter page: the welcome, the
**New Person** and **New Household** buttons, and the quick links. They are not shown a checklist they cannot
finish or an error count for a log they cannot open. The page does not work those numbers
out for staff at all, so it loads faster for them; if you edit the page to show an
administrator tile to staff, it shows nothing to count.

## How Records Open: Tabs in a Console

Every BarnCRM app shows Patch, the BarnCRM highland cow, in the app launcher, and every app has
the same Barn Navy header (#1E2A3A), so you always know you are in BarnCRM. The logo tells the
apps apart: **BarnCRM** and **BarnCRM Console** show Patch's face on a sage circle, the admin apps
show Patch standing in a round badge, and each module app shows Patch with its module's prop (a
heart for **BarnCRM Fundraising**, a safety vest for **BarnCRM Volunteers**, a cap and clipboard
for **BarnCRM Programs**, a monocle for **BarnCRM Grants**, a pencil and tool belt for **BarnCRM
Forms**, a party hat for **BarnCRM Events**, a hard hat for **BarnCRM Projects** and a tool belt
for **BarnCRM Portal Builder**; **BarnCRM Corporate Hub** shows Patch's face for now). Logic
Models has no app since release 1.24; Patch with building blocks marks its tile under
**Modules** on the BarnCRM home page.
**BarnCRM Console** and
**BarnCRM Admin Console** are console apps: instead of replacing the page each time you click,
they keep the records you are working on open side by side in tabs across the top. In
**BarnCRM** and **BarnCRM Admin** each record replaces the page, as in most Salesforce apps.

- **Households, organizations, people and Error Log entries open in their own tab** (a
  workspace tab). Open three households and you have three tabs; click one to go back to it.
- **The records that belong to one of them open inside its tab** (a subtab):
  - an address opens under its household,
  - a relationship or an affiliation opens under the person it belongs to,
  - a household member row opens under its household.

  If that link is blank (for example an address that belongs to a person, not a household),
  the record opens in its own tab instead.
- **Pages such as Data Manager and BarnCRM Settings open as tabs too.** Choose them from the
  navigation menu (the arrow next to the app name). In **BarnCRM Console**, Addresses,
  Relationships, Affiliations and Household Members follow Organizations, and Data Manager
  ends the Core part of that menu. In **BarnCRM
  Admin Console** the menu holds BarnCRM Settings, Data Manager, Org Optimizer, Duplicate
  Matching and Error Log. Find and Import open as tabs from their Data Manager tiles.
- **Close a tab** with its **x**, or right-click tabs to close several. Your open tabs are
  still there when you come back.
- **On a phone**, the Salesforce mobile app shows each BarnCRM app as an ordinary app without
  tabs.

## A Five-Minute Walkthrough

Maria has just installed BarnCRM and has the sample data loaded. She has the BarnCRM
Admin role.

1. Open the app launcher, type `BarnCRM`, and choose **BarnCRM** (or **BarnCRM Console**). The home page
   opens with the heading **Welcome to BarnCRM** and the sentence "Start with the setup
   checklist below.", with Patch waving hello beside it (on a wide screen).
2. Read the **Setup Checklist**. It lists every step with a progress ring and a **Done**,
   **Skipped** or **To Do** badge, opens the first step you have not finished, and counts how
   far you have got, for example "3 of 9 steps done" (eight steps with Core alone, nine with
   Giving). The steps are guided: each one is done here, on the home page.
3. The first step, **Choose Your Edition**, is already **Done**: you chose the edition in the
   first-run setup window, and the step only shows that answer.
4. The next step, **Confirm How BarnCRM Fits Your Org**, says what it found in
   your org and recommends a fit. On a fresh org it says "This looks like a fresh org, with
   no other household model and no Person Accounts. BarnCRM can run on its own." and
   recommends **Standalone**. If your org uses Person Accounts, it says so plainly, and
   household membership uses one record per person so that what you already have keeps
   working. Click **Confirm and Continue**.
5. Use **Next** and **Skip for Now**, or click any step's name, to move around. Skipping
   does not mark a step done: it moves the step out of the way and offers it to you again
   next time. The full walkthrough of every step is in [setup-assistant.md](setup-assistant.md).
6. Below the checklist, **Health Check** shows a summary of its last run: a badge (**Not
   Run Yet**, **Passed**, or how many errors or warnings it found) and when it ran. Click
   **Run Now** to check the org again and see every finding as a row, with a button to fix it
   where it can. These are the same rows as the Health Check tab of Org Optimizer. The full
   guide is [health-check.md](health-check.md).
7. Look at the status tiles, each with an icon and a badge. **Errors to Review** shows the
   count of new errors, with **All Clear** when there are none. If it ever shows a number,
   click **Open the Error Log** and read the plain-language message on each row. The tile
   counts up to 999; past that it says `999+`, so a flooded Error Log never slows the home
   page down.
8. Look at **Rollups Last Completed** and **Seasonal Addresses Last Swapped**. Each says
   when that nightly job last finished. Before a job has ever run, the tile says so with a
   **Not Run Yet** badge and no warning. If a job that has run before is more than 36 hours
   late, the tile shows an **Overdue** badge and says so in words, and its link opens the
   settings page where you can run it.
9. If someone has paused automation (for example during a large import), a warning under
   the welcome says BarnCRM automation is paused; administrators also get a **Resume
   Automation** link to the Automation section of BarnCRM Settings. The warning disappears by
   itself when the pause expires.
10. Look at **Modules**. It lists BarnCRM Core and each module installed in your org (with
    Giving, that is Giving), each with its app's logo, and says for each whether it is on or
    installed and off. Click
    **Open the Module Manager** to turn a module on or off.
11. Use **Quick Links**, icon tiles, to open People, Households, Organizations, Find, Import a
    File, each installed module's links (Enter a Gift, Log Hours, Enroll) or BarnCRM Settings
    without going back to the app launcher. A module link to a tab shows only to someone who
    can see that tab.
12. Click **New Person** under the welcome to add someone; the household is made for them.
    Once setup is finished, the welcome reads "Find someone, add someone new, or pick up
    where you left off."

That is the whole home page. Five minutes, and you know what is done, what is next, and
whether anything went wrong.

When every step is done, the checklist collapses to a small **Setup Complete** tile, and
the welcome sentence points at the tabs instead of the checklist.

## Working in Console Tabs

When the app you are in is a console app (tabs across the top, each holding its own
subtabs), BarnCRM pages use those tabs instead of replacing the page you are on:

- A record you open from a BarnCRM panel opens as a subtab of the tab you are in. That
  covers the household link on a person, a record a Health Check finding names, a record
  in a duplicate suggestion, and an entry in the Error Log tile. Hold Ctrl (Cmd on a Mac)
  while clicking to open the record in a new browser tab instead.
- **BarnCRM Settings**, **Import**, **Find** and **Rollup Builder** name their tab for what
  is on screen, for example "BarnCRM Settings: People and Households", "Import: donors.csv",
  "Find: Contact" or "Rollup Builder: Household total giving", with the page's own icon.
- After **Merge** or **Split** in Household Merge and Split, the household's tab refreshes
  in place, and a split opens the other household as a subtab beside it.

In a standard (non-console) app, and in an org that uses another app, these pages work
exactly as before: records open as pages and nothing is renamed. There is nothing to turn
on.

## Rearranging the Home Page

The home page is a standard Lightning page, and each tile on it is its own component, so
you can move, remove, or add tiles in the Lightning App Builder without any code.

1. Open the home page, click the gear icon, then **Edit Page**.
2. Drag a tile to another region, or select it and click the delete icon to remove it.
   The BarnCRM tiles are listed under **Custom** with names that start with
   **BarnCRM Home**, plus **Health Check**.
3. To add something of your own, drag in a standard component: **List View** (for example
   your households), **Report Chart**, or **Rich Text** for a note to your team.
4. To show a tile only to some people, select it and use **Set Component Visibility**. The
   administrator tiles use the filter **Permissions, Custom Permission, Manage BarnCRM
   Settings, equals true**. Use the same filter to hide your own tiles from staff.
5. Click **Save**. If the App Builder says the page cannot be edited because it came with
   the package, click **Save As** to make your own copy, then **Activation** to make the
   copy the home page of the **BarnCRM** and **BarnCRM Console** apps.

A copy you made does not receive changes from later BarnCRM versions. After an upgrade,
compare it with the page that came with the package.

## Common Mistakes

- **Looking for the app in Setup.** BarnCRM is an app, not a Setup page. Use the app
  launcher, not the gear icon. If `BarnCRM` does not appear in the app launcher, you
  have not been assigned a BarnCRM role: ask whoever installed the package to add you
  on the Access page. If the role was given a moment ago, wait a minute: BarnCRM gives the
  apps in a queued job.
- **Looking for BarnCRM Settings in the BarnCRM app.** The settings and the admin tools are in
  **BarnCRM Admin** and **BarnCRM Admin Console**, which only the BarnCRM Admin role sees.
  **Data Manager** is in the BarnCRM apps too, for anyone with the Find and Export, Bulk Update
  or Bulk Delete permission. Someone without the admin role who has the Duplicate Review
  permission opens Org Optimizer or Duplicate Matching by typing its name in the app launcher.
- **Looking for Find, Import or Super Transformer in the navigation.** None is in any app's
  navigation: open **Data Manager** and choose the **Find and Export Records**, **Import a
  File** or **Super Transformer** card. Recent Super Transformer runs and their undo are under **Data
  Jobs** on the same page.
- **Hiding a style and wondering why a person still has it as their default.** **App
  Navigation Style** takes the other style's apps away; the next time that person opens
  Salesforce they land in an app they can still see. Nothing else about their access changes.
- **Wondering where the checklist went for a staff member.** The checklist, the Health
  Check and the status tiles show only to people with the Manage BarnCRM Settings
  permission. A staff member sees the welcome and the quick links, on purpose.
- **Treating Skip for now as done.** Skipping moves you on without finishing the step, on
  purpose, so that a step waiting for a module you have not installed does not block you. A
  skipped step is still waiting for you next time.
- **Reading the checklist as a one-time task.** When every step is done the checklist
  collapses to a small **Setup Complete** tile with a **Reopen Setup** button. Re-run it
  whenever your organization changes: a new fiscal year, a new staff member, a new address.
- **Expecting a record to replace the page.** In the console, a record opens in a tab and
  the page you were on stays open in its own tab. If the screen feels crowded, close the tabs
  you have finished with.
- **Updating an org that already had the BarnCRM app without tabs.** Salesforce will not
  switch an existing app to console tabs during a deployment, and the console app keeps the
  old app's API name (`BarnCRM`), now labelled **BarnCRM Console**. Before deploying, open
  Setup, **App Manager**, click the arrow next to that app, choose **Edit**, then under **App
  Options** set **Navigation Style** to **Console Navigation** and save. A new installation
  needs nothing.
- **Assuming an empty Errors tile means nothing failed.** The tile counts errors with the
  status **New**. If someone has already marked an error Acknowledged or Resolved, it
  stops counting. Open the Error Log tab to see everything.
