# Editions

## What It Does

BarnCRM is one suite of tools that comes in two editions. Both have the full core suite of
tools: people, households, relationships, addresses, imports with undo, Find and Super Transformer,
duplicate review, Org Optimizer, Health Check, settings and the rest of BarnCRM Core.

| Edition | For | What BarnCRM shows |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard Edition** | Any Salesforce org: businesses, clubs, associations, any organization | The core suite and the modules every edition offers: BarnCRM Rollup Builder, BarnCRM Forms, BarnCRM Contact Point Sync, BarnCRM Event Management, BarnCRM Portal Builder and BarnCRM Mirror (it needs only Core). No nonprofit modules are listed or offered anywhere. |
| **Nonprofit Edition** | Nonprofits, or any organization that wants the nonprofit tools | The core suite, BarnCRM Rollup Builder, BarnCRM Forms, BarnCRM Contact Point Sync, BarnCRM Event Management, BarnCRM Portal Builder, BarnCRM Mirror, and the nonprofit modules: BarnCRM Giving, BarnCRM Volunteers, BarnCRM Programs, BarnCRM Logic Models, BarnCRM Grants and BarnCRM Mirror for Giving. |

The edition decides what BarnCRM shows and offers. It never installs, removes or changes
anything: every module is a separate package that you install yourself through Salesforce's
installer, and no records change when the edition changes. You install a module from the
**Modules** section of BarnCRM Settings, which opens Salesforce's installer. Install modules as
packages: the install runs each module's setup steps. A module copied into an org by hand skips
them, and the Modules section then offers **Finish Setup** as a recovery step (see
[Module Manager](module-manager.md#when-a-modules-setup-never-ran)). Which editions
offer each module ships with BarnCRM as data (BarnCRM Module records), so a module offered to
both editions, such as BarnCRM Rollup Builder, simply appears in both. The Modules section
links each installed module that has an app of its own to that app. The Core features
(see [BarnCRM Settings, Features](barncrm-settings.md#features-general)) are the same in both
editions.

You choose the edition once, in the first-run setup window that the BarnCRM home page and
BarnCRM Settings both show until an administrator finishes it (see
[BarnCRM Settings, First-run setup](barncrm-settings.md#first-run-setup)). After that the
Setup Assistant's first step shows the edition you chose and no longer offers the choice,
because changing it later is rare and changes what everyone sees.

## What Each Edition Shows

These are the places that depend on the edition.

| Where | Standard Edition | Nonprofit Edition |
|---|---|---|
| Setup Assistant, module step | Core, BarnCRM Rollup Builder, plus any module that is already installed | Core, BarnCRM Rollup Builder and all five nonprofit modules, each Present or Not installed with its Install link |
| BarnCRM Settings, Modules ([Module Manager](module-manager.md)) | The same list as the module step, Installed with an app link, or Not installed with Install | The same list as the module step, Installed with an app link, or Not installed with Install |
| BarnCRM home page, Modules card | The same list | The same list |
| Health Check, "The Gift Transaction Mirror Is in the Mirror for Giving Module" (Nonprofit Cloud orgs only) | Not shown | Shown when BarnCRM Mirror for Giving is not installed |
| Setup Assistant, first step | Edition shown read-only | Edition shown read-only, with the BarnCRM Giving install link while it is not installed |

Before anyone has chosen an edition, BarnCRM shows what the Standard Edition shows.

Install links appear only once BarnCRM publishes package versions. Until then each place above
shows "No install link is published for this module yet." in place of **Install**.

A module that is installed keeps working whatever the edition: it stays listed, its own
settings sections, Setup Assistant steps, Health Check findings, What's New notes, roles and
tabs stay, and its automation keeps running. If a module was installed by mistake, turn it off
or uninstall it from the [Module Manager](module-manager.md); changing the edition does not.

## How to Change the Edition Later

You need the **Manage BarnCRM Settings** permission (BarnCRM Admin has it). There are two
ways, and they do the same thing.

### In BarnCRM Settings (Recommended)

1. Open the app launcher, type `BarnCRM`, and choose **BarnCRM Admin**.
2. Click **BarnCRM Settings**, then **General** in the left navigation.
3. Find **Edition**. It shows the edition in force, for example "Standard Edition".
4. Click **Change Edition** under it. It opens a short explanation and a button for the other
   edition, for example **Switch to the Nonprofit Edition**.
5. Click that button. A confirmation says what changes. Click **Change Edition** to confirm,
   or **Cancel** to leave it as it is.

The change is saved at once and listed under **Recent Changes** at the bottom of BarnCRM
Settings, with the old and new edition by name (for example "Standard Edition"). Reload any open BarnCRM page to see the new module lists.

### In Salesforce Setup

1. Open **Setup**, type `Custom Settings` in Quick Find, and click **Custom Settings**.
2. Click **Manage** next to **BarnCRM Settings**.
3. Click **Edit** on the organization default row (the row under **Default Organization Level
   Value**).
4. Set **Edition** to `Standard` for the Standard Edition or `Nonprofit` for the Nonprofit
   Edition, exactly as written. These are the stored values; the names people read are
   Standard Edition and Nonprofit Edition.
5. Click **Save**.

Any other value is treated as no edition chosen. A change made in Setup is not listed under
Recent Changes, so prefer **BarnCRM Settings, General** (above). Setting the edition here
before first-run setup does not skip it: the setup window still shows, with that edition
already selected, so that you choose the features too.

## Common Mistakes

- **Expecting the Nonprofit Edition to install BarnCRM Giving.** It only offers it. Install it from
  the Setup Assistant's first step or from the Module Manager.
- **Switching to the Standard Edition to remove a module.** An installed module stays installed
  and keeps working. Turn it off or uninstall it in the Module Manager.
- **Typing `Standard Edition` or `Nonprofit Edition` in Setup.** The stored values are
  `Standard` and `Nonprofit`, without the word Edition.
- **Looking for the choice in the Setup Assistant after the first run.** Starting the assistant
  again keeps the edition; change it in BarnCRM Settings as above.
