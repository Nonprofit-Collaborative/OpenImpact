# Duplicates

## What It Does

Finds people and households that are in your database twice, and helps you deal with them one
pair at a time, on the **Duplicate Matching** tab. Salesforce does the finding, with the duplicate rules every org starts with:
it warns the person typing that somebody similar already exists. What Salesforce does not do
in most editions is look through the records you already have, so a spreadsheet imported last
year is never checked against itself. BarnCRM adds that scan, lists every pair on one page,
and puts the household merge one click away.

Nothing is merged or deleted without you. Every merge is a pair you looked at and confirmed,
or, with **Auto-Merge**, a list of exact matches you previewed and confirmed together, which
you can undo for 15 days; see [Auto-Merge](#auto-merge).

Salesforce's rules only compare fields on the person or household itself. The scan also looks
at **match sources**: related records such as contact point emails, phones and addresses, and
BarnCRM addresses. Two people who share an email held only on a contact point email record are
listed too, with a line saying why, for example "Same email on Contact Point Email". Match
sources are listed, added, deactivated and tried out in the tool's **Matching Logic** area;
see [Matching Logic](#matching-logic).

BarnCRM addresses are read by their **Match Key**, a field BarnCRM fills on every save with the
postal code and house number, so a large org's scan does not search every street. Addresses
saved before version 1.22 get their key when you choose **Fill Match Keys** on Health Check's
**Match Keys Not Filled** finding; until it finishes, matching on addresses works as before,
only slower. An address the job could not save is named in the Error Log with the reason, and
is read by address again once you fix it and save it (see
[Health Check](health-check.md)).

The scan also compares **people's names**, ignoring case, spacing and punctuation, so "Jonathan
Smith" and "Jonathon Smith" are noticed. A similar name is never enough on its own, and the
scan knows about households; see [Similar Names](#similar-names).

A household pair a duplicate rule finds is listed only when the two households also share real
evidence: the same billing street with the same city or postal code, the same phone, or the
same name with the same postal code. Salesforce's standard account rule treats household names
such as "The Hall Family" and "The Shah-Duarte Family" as alike and then pairs them on the
billing city alone, so without this check every two households in one city would be listed. A
city, a state or both are never enough, and a blank value never matches a blank one. The
check also applies to suggestions the rule writes when a household is saved: a household in
one that shares only a city with the others is left off the card, and a card left with fewer
than two households is not shown.

## How to Turn It On

There is nothing to install, but on a new install the **Duplicate Matching** feature is off
until you turn it on: choose **Turn On** in the **Duplicate Matching** row in **BarnCRM
Settings**, **General** (or leave it ticked in first-run setup); see
[BarnCRM Settings](barncrm-settings.md). While it is off the **Duplicate Matching** tab is
hidden for everyone. Salesforce switches on its standard duplicate rules
for people and accounts in every new org, and BarnCRM uses them. There is one permission
step, because of a Salesforce licensing rule:

**Who can review duplicates.** Salesforce keeps possible duplicates in records called duplicate
record sets, and gives access to them only to users with a **Sales Cloud or Service Cloud
license**. No other license can have it, Salesforce Platform included. So BarnCRM puts that
access in its own permission set, **BarnCRM Duplicate Review**, which is in no role. In BarnCRM
Settings, open **Access** and, under **Extra Permissions**, give **BarnCRM Duplicate Review** to
each person who will review duplicates. Salesforce refuses the assignment for a user
without one of those licenses. A holder who is not an administrator also gets the **Duplicate
Matching** tab with its **Review** area, which they can read; scanning, dismissing and
merging there stay with BarnCRM Admin. If nobody in your org has one, duplicate rules still warn people
as they type, but nobody can review or merge suggestions: not on this panel, and not on the
**Potential Duplicates** card on a contact's page, which reads the same records and shows a
Platform user nothing usable.

**Who sees the tab.** BarnCRM gives the **Duplicate Matching** tab automatically, while the
feature is on, to holders of **BarnCRM Admin**, **BarnCRM Duplicate Review** and **BarnCRM
Metadata Admin** (see [Access](access.md)).

1. Open the **BarnCRM Admin** app and choose the **Duplicate Matching** tab (someone without
   that app, such as a Duplicate Review holder, finds the tab in the App Launcher). (In **BarnCRM
   Settings**, the **Duplicate Matching** section's **Duplicate Matching** row has an **Open
   this page** button that brings you here too.)
2. The **Review** area opens first.
3. Under **Duplicate Rules** each rule for people and accounts is listed with On or Off. At
   least one should say On. If none does, see Common mistakes below.
4. Choose **Scan for Duplicates**. The scan looks through the people and households you
   already have. It runs in the background and can take a while in a large database.
5. When it finishes, the line under the button says what the last scan did, for example
   "Duplicate scan of Contact, Account finished: 3 new possible duplicates recorded." If part of
   the database could not be checked, the line is red and says how many batches of up to 50
   records could not be checked; see Common mistakes below.

Run the scan again after a large import: Salesforce checks a record against the others when
it is saved, but an import that saved past a warning leaves the pair for the scan to find.

**The review list.** The page calls each possible duplicate a suggestion: usually a pair, and
sometimes three or more records a duplicate rule reported together. The **Review** tab and
**Possible Duplicates** both show how many suggestions are waiting (for example **Review
(40)**, or 50+ when there are more than the list reads at once), then the first 10
suggestions, newest first. Each suggestion is one card: why it was suggested and its buttons
at the top (**Merge Households** is the main button on a household pair), then the records
side by side. A card with three or more records says "Each record is compared with (the first
record's name), the first one.", and each **Different** badge on the others means different
from that first record. Each side shows the record's name (a link to it), Person or Household,
and the fields compared: for a person the email, phone, mailing street, city and postal code,
and household; for a household the billing street, city and postal code, and phone. Only
fields you can read are shown. A value that is not the same on both sides carries a
**Different** badge, so you see at a glance what sets the two apart. On a narrow screen the
sides stack. **Show More** adds the next 10, and the line
under the list says how many are showing. The note on merging two people is shown once, above
the list, not on every card. **Not a Duplicate** and **Merge Households** open their short
form inside the suggestion's own card. When nothing is waiting the list shows **No Possible
Duplicates** with a reminder to scan after a large import.

### Duplicate Rules Starter

Salesforce's standard rules pair households on a shared city and miss people who share an
email but not a company. The **Duplicate Rules Starter** writes BarnCRM's recommended rules
into your org instead:

- **People** (Contact): the same first and last name, plus the same email, or the same mailing
  street and postal code, or the same phone.
- **Households** (Account, Household record type only, so organizations are never compared):
  the same billing street with the same city or postal code, the same phone, or the same name
  with the same postal code.

Each is one matching rule and one duplicate rule, named **BarnCRM People Match** and
**BarnCRM People Duplicates** (and the Household pair). The duplicate rules allow the save,
alert the person saving and report the pair, so imports and the scan keep working.

1. On **Duplicate Matching**, **Review**, choose **Duplicate Rules Starter** under the rules
   box (BarnCRM Admin only).
2. Each set shows the rule in words, your own duplicate rules on that object (always left as
   they are), and what **Set Up Rules** will do: create both rules, or repair BarnCRM's rules
   if they were turned off. A set that is already active says **Set up and active.**
3. Tick the sets to set up, choose **Set Up Rules**, read the steps in the dialog and confirm.
4. A background job writes the matching rules, waits for Salesforce to activate them (a few
   minutes; it checks every minute for up to 15), then writes the duplicate rules. The page
   checks every 10 seconds and shows the result in words; the Error Log keeps it too.

What it never does: change, deactivate or delete a rule that is not named BarnCRM, or edit an
active BarnCRM matching rule (Salesforce refuses edits to an active one). With your own rule
and BarnCRM's both active on one object, a save can alert twice; turn one off in **Setup**,
**Duplicate Rules** if you want only one.

**Needs:** the org connection that Super Importer uses to create a field (see
[Creating a Field From an Import](import-new-fields.md)), with **BarnCRM Metadata Admin**,
Customize Application and Modify Metadata. Without it the starter says so, shows the connection
panel, and the rules can be created by hand in Setup from the descriptions shown. In an org
with person accounts the people rule covers people stored as contacts only.

### Settings

In **BarnCRM Settings**, the **Duplicate Matching** section holds the tool's settings: a note
on the one Setup step (keep the duplicate rules active, give reviewers Duplicate Review) and
the **Duplicate Matching** row, whose **Open This Page** button opens the tab. The scan always
checks every person and household with your active duplicate rules, your active match sources
and similar names. Two settings sit beside the row, each with a default you can change:

- **Fuzzy name match** (default 90): how alike two names must be, in percent, before the scan
  pairs two people by name. From 80 to 100; 100 pairs only names that are the same once case,
  spacing and punctuation are ignored.
- **Merge rule for other fields** (default **Not blank**): which value a field keeps when two
  people are merged and the field has no [merge rule](#merge-rules) of its own.
- **Exact match for auto-merge** (default **Name and email**): what two people must share
  exactly before [auto-merge](#auto-merge) takes them: **Name and email**, **Name and phone**,
  **Name, email and phone** or **Name and birthdate**.
- **Turn On Merge Records** (default off): turns on [Merge Records](#merge-records) on the tab.

### Similar Names

In each pass over people, the scan scores the names of people who share a last name or an email,
from 0 to 100 percent alike (case, spacing and punctuation do not count). Two people at or above
**Fuzzy name match** are listed when they also:

- share an email or a phone number (digits only, so "(555) 010-2000" and "555.010.2000" are
  the same), or
- are in different households and share a mailing postal code.

Within one household an address is shared by design and similar names are usually family
(Daniel and Danielle), so there two people with nothing else in common are listed only when
their names are exactly the same. Two people whose birthdates are both filled in and differ are
never listed. The line under the pair says why, for example **Similar names (97%) and the same
email** or **Same name in the same household**.

### Merge Rules

Merge rules decide which value wins, field by field, when two people are merged by auto-merge.
Each rule names one person field and one of five choices:

| Rule | The kept person ends with |
|---|---|
| **Keep master** | Its own value, even a blank. |
| **Not blank** | Its own value, or the other person's when its own is blank. |
| **Most recent** | The value of whichever person was changed last. |
| **Oldest record** | The value of whichever person was created first. |
| **Most complete** | The longer of the two values (its own on a tie). |

Except under **Keep master**, a blank never replaces a value. Add rules in **BarnCRM Settings**,
**Custom Metadata**, **Merge Rules**: **Field Name** is the field's API name (for example
`Email` or `Title`), or `MailingAddress` or `OtherAddress` to take a whole address from one
person, so a street never lands with the other person's city. A field with no rule follows
**Merge rule for other fields**. The household and the record owner always stay the kept
person's. Saving a rule needs BarnCRM Admin or BarnCRM Metadata Admin.

For [Merge Records](#merge-records), name the object and the field with a dot and no namespace
prefix, for example `Fund__c.Description__c`. That rule sets the starting choice for the field
when two funds are compared; you can still change it before you merge.

### Auto-Merge

The **Auto-Merge** area of the **Duplicate Matching** tab merges the obvious duplicates in one
go, so you stop merging them one pair at a time. It needs Manage BarnCRM Settings (BarnCRM
Admin) and BarnCRM Duplicate Review, like the review list it works from.

1. Click **Preview Exact Matches**. BarnCRM reads the people pairs waiting in the review list
   and keeps only those that meet **Exact match for auto-merge**: the same first and last name
   (ignoring case, spacing and punctuation) and the same email, phone (digits) or birthdate,
   filled in on both. Households are never auto-merged.
2. Read the list. Each row shows the person kept, the person merged away, and the values the
   [merge rules](#merge-rules) will change on the kept person. The kept person is the one whose
   household has more members, so nobody is pulled out of their family; with equal households,
   the record created first is kept.
3. Click **Merge Pairs** and confirm. The merge runs in the background, as you, with your
   access: a pair you cannot edit is skipped. Each pair is checked again just before it is
   merged; one that has changed or been dismissed is skipped. At most 1,000 pairs a run. The
   bell tells you when it finishes.

Every merge is written down. Under **Recent Runs**, each run shows how many people it merged;
**Undo** puts the whole run back:

- each merged-away person is restored from the Recycle Bin (the real record, never a copy);
- each value the rules changed on the kept person goes back, unless somebody changed it since;
- each related record the merge moved (activities, memberships, relationships and anything else
  whose link can be changed) moves back to the restored person, unless it was moved or deleted
  since.

What undo cannot put back is listed under the run: for example a person no longer in the
Recycle Bin (it keeps people for 15 days, or until someone empties it), a value changed after
the merge, or a related record deleted since. Undo is offered for 15 days. After an undo the
two people are separate again; the next scan suggests them again.

### Merge Records

**Merge Records** merges two records of the same BarnCRM object: two funds, two appeals, two
programs, two import mappings, and so on. People and households keep their own merge (above).
It is off on a new install, and the area says so: turn on **Turn On Merge Records** in
**BarnCRM Settings**, **Duplicate Matching**. It needs Manage BarnCRM Settings (BarnCRM Admin).

The objects offered are BarnCRM's own objects that you may edit, delete and restore from the
Recycle Bin. BarnCRM's logs, journals and settings objects are never offered. Where BarnCRM is
installed without a namespace (an unmanaged install), every custom object is offered.

1. Open the **Duplicate Matching** tab, then **Merge Records**.
2. Choose the **Object**, then the two records. Click **Compare**.
3. Choose the **Record to Keep**. The other one goes to the Recycle Bin.
4. Read the fields side by side. For each field, the value the record keeps is selected; it
   starts from the [merge rules](#merge-rules). Change any choice. Tick **Only Differences**
   to hide the fields that already match. A unique field, the owner and the record type always
   stay the kept record's.
5. Click **Merge** and confirm.

What happens, all at once or not at all, as you and with your access:

- every related record (gifts, shifts, activities, anything whose link to the other record can
  be changed) moves to the kept record;
- every file and note on the other record is also linked to the kept record (one already linked
  there is left as it is);
- the other record goes to the Recycle Bin;
- the kept record takes the values you chose.

BarnCRM does not merge, and changes nothing, when a related record would be lost: one you
cannot read, or one under a master-detail link that cannot be changed (it would be deleted with
the record). The message names it.

Under **Recent Merges**, each merge of the last 15 days is listed with **Undo**, which works as
auto-merge's undo does: the other record comes back from the Recycle Bin, the kept record gets
its own values back unless somebody changed them since, the related records move back, and the
file links the merge added are removed from the kept record. What undo cannot restore is listed under the merge.

### Matching Logic

The **Matching Logic** area of the **Duplicate Matching** tab lists the match sources: the
related records the scan and imports look at, alongside your Salesforce duplicate rules, to
tell that two people or two households are the same. The rules themselves are listed, read
only, in **Review**, with a link to change them in Setup.

Who sees it: anyone with **Manage BarnCRM Settings** (BarnCRM Admin) or the **BarnCRM
Metadata Admin** permission set. Adding, changing, deactivating and activating a source
needs **BarnCRM Admin** (which includes the permission) or **BarnCRM Metadata Admin**, because
saving one changes the org's metadata; without either the list is read only, and **Try a Value** still works. If BarnCRM was installed as a
package, saving also needs **Deploy Metadata from Non-Certified Package Versions via Apex**
turned on in Setup, **Apex Settings**; see [Custom metadata](custom-metadata.md#how-to-turn-it-on).

The area opens with one line on what match sources are; the help icon beside it says how they
work with your duplicate rules and how saving works. Each source is a card: its name, a
**Shipped with BarnCRM** badge where it applies, and one line saying what it compares, for
example "Email Address on Contact Point Email, compared as Email". With permission to save
the card has an **Active** switch; without it, an **Active** or **Inactive** badge. **Show
Details** on a card lists, in words:

- **Object**: the related object, for example Contact Point Email.
- **Value compared**: the field holding the value: the email, the phone number, or the street.
- **Postal code field**: address sources only; the postal code compared with the street.
- **Belongs to**: a person, a household (or person account), or either.
- **Linked through the field**: the field linking the value to its person or household.
- **How values are compared**: Email, Phone or Address, with what is ignored.

A source that cannot work in this org (its object
or a field is missing, or you cannot read it) says **Not used in this org** and is skipped.

BarnCRM ships six sources, marked **Shipped with BarnCRM**:

| Source | Object | Value compared | Linked through the field | Compared as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Contact Point Email | Contact Point Email | Email Address | Parent | Email |
| Contact Point Phone | Contact Point Phone | Telephone Number | Parent | Phone |
| Contact Point Address | Contact Point Address | Street, with Postal Code | Parent | Address |
| Address (person) | Address | Street, with Postal Code | Contact | Address |
| Address (household) | Address | Street, with Postal Code | Account | Address |
| Address (person account) | Address | Street, with Postal Code | Person Account | Address |

The contact point objects exist only in some orgs (Nonprofit Cloud has them). Where an
object is missing, its source does nothing; nothing breaks. A shipped source can be
turned off and on again with its **Active** switch, but not changed. Turning a shipped source
off or on is saved at once as a setting (D-184), so there is nothing to wait for, and upgrades
leave it as you set it while keeping the source itself up to date; they never overwrite what
you added. Your own sources are saved as metadata and take about a minute.

How values are compared:

- **Email**: spaces at either end are ignored, and capitals do not matter.
- **Phone**: only the digits count, so (555) 123-4567 and 555.123.4567 match. A North
  American number written with a leading 1 matches the same number without it. A number with
  fewer than seven digits is ignored.
- **Address**: the street, with capitals, punctuation and extra spaces ignored and common
  words shortened (Street and St, Avenue and Ave match), together with the postal code
  (spaces ignored; a ZIP+4 counts as its first five digits).

A contact point record can belong to a person, an account, or a Salesforce **Individual**
(the privacy record behind a person). A person or an account is used as it is; an Individual
counts as every person who carries it, contacts and, where your org has person accounts,
person accounts too. A record that belongs to anything else is skipped.

**Add a source.** Choose **Add**: the form opens in a window over the page (Escape or
**Cancel** closes it). Fill in **Name**, then the object's API name under **Object** (for
example `Volunteer_Profile__c`) and choose **Find Fields**: the
**Value compared** and **Linked through the field** lists then offer only the fields that can
work (text, email or phone fields Salesforce can search on, and lookups to a contact, an
account or an Individual). Choose **How values are compared**; for **Address**, also choose
the **Postal code field**. **Save** checks the source against the org and refuses anything
that cannot work, saying why in the window, which stays open. Once the source is accepted the
window closes. Saving takes about a minute, because Salesforce applies it in the background:
the area says "Saving", then "Saved" and lists the source. If you leave before then, choose
**Check Again** when you come back. A source you added has **Edit** as well, which opens the
same window with the source's values filled in.

**Deactivate a source.** Turn off the **Active** switch on its card; turning it on brings the
source back. The switch moves once Salesforce has applied the change (about a minute).
Salesforce does not let an app delete custom metadata, so a source is deactivated instead.

**Try a value.** Choose **Try a Value** on a card, type an email, phone or street (and, for
an address, the postal code), and choose **Try**. The area shows the value as the source
compares it ("Compared as: 12 n main st|02139") and lists the people and households you can
see that hold it. Nothing is saved. A value too short to compare says so.

A value shared by more than ten people or households, such as an office's main number, is
ignored: it says nothing about whether two of them are the same.

Each lookup reads at most 5,000 records. When a lookup reaches that limit, or a scan or import
step has used most of what Salesforce allows in one go so a source is skipped, the Error Log
gets one warning naming the source, and the values that lookup found are not used, since some
of the records holding them were not read. Some duplicates may then be missed until the next
scan. A source whose values are very common is a candidate to deactivate.

## A Five-Minute Walkthrough

Start with the sample data loaded (see [sample-data.md](sample-data.md)). Create one duplicate
on purpose: open any sample person, note their email address, and create a new contact with
the same first name, last name and email. Salesforce warns you that a similar record exists;
choose to save anyway.

1. Open the **Duplicate Matching** tab. The **Review** area opens.
2. Choose **Scan for Duplicates**. You see "Scan started. The bell tells you when it
   finishes." While it runs, the panel says "A scan is running. The bell tells you when it
   finishes."
3. When the bell's **Duplicate scan finished** notification arrives, choose **Refresh**. Under
   **Possible Duplicates** you see the pair you made, each person with their email address.
4. Choose **Compare and Merge** on the pair. The first person's record opens (in a console, as
   a subtab). On the right of the page the **Potential Duplicates** card names the other
   record. Choose **View Duplicates**, then **Compare and merge**, pick the values to keep, and
   confirm. (**Not a Duplicate** stays on the pair, in the list.) Salesforce allows this only to people with
   Delete on contacts (on accounts, for person accounts): BarnCRM Admin has it, and the staff
   roles deliberately do not, so staff ask an admin to merge two people. Merging two
   households needs no Delete permission (see
   [Household merge and split](household-merge-split.md)). This is Salesforce's own merge, and it keeps
   the activities and files of both (and, with Giving, their gifts). BarnCRM then adds the
   kept person to any household the other one belonged to, and recalculates their totals
   straight away. A household the other person leaves empty is kept, not deleted, because
   records can still point at it: merge it into the kept person's household with **Merge Households** (step 6).
   Within a minute or so BarnCRM also tidies the kept person in the background: one default
   address stays (see [Addresses](addresses.md)), a relationship the two records had with each
   other is removed, so is a second copy of a relationship both had with the same person, and
   their primary affiliation is chosen again.
5. Back on the Duplicates panel, refresh. The pair is gone.
6. If the scan found two households, choose **Merge Households** on the pair. You see the two
   side by side, the fields where they disagree, and which one is kept. Choose the household to
   keep and choose **Merge These Two**. You see "The two households are now one."
7. For a pair that is not the same person, for example twin sisters at one address, choose
   **Not a Duplicate**, type a short reason, and confirm. You see "Noted. This suggestion will
   not come back." Scan again and check that the pair does not come back. It stays off the
   panel even when a duplicate rule reports the pair again as someone saves one of the two.
   A suggestion that names three or more records (one a duplicate rule wrote as someone saved)
   is dismissed as a whole: every pair in it is noted. If two of them are in fact the same
   person, merge those first, then dismiss the rest.

### Pairs Found Through Related Records

Each pair on the list says why it is there: the name of the duplicate rule that found it, or,
for a pair a match source found, what the two share and where ("Same address on Address
(person)"). A pair both a rule and a source found is listed once, under the rule. Review,
merge and dismiss these pairs exactly like the others; a dismissed pair is not proposed again
by either.

Limits to know:

- **A match source pair still needs an active duplicate rule for the same kind of record.**
  Salesforce will not store a suggestion without one. With no active rule for people, the scan
  does not run its people pass at all, sources included. Salesforce's own **Duplicate Record
  Sets** tab, and any report on it, shows a match source pair under that active rule's name,
  because Salesforce makes every suggestion name a rule; the reason is shown only here, on the
  review list.
- **A value shared by more than ten people or households is ignored**, such as an office's
  main number, because it says nothing about whether two of them are the same.
- **People in the same household are not paired by a shared phone or address**, since that
  is what living together looks like. A shared email still pairs them.
- **Pairs are proposed between contacts or between households.** A person stored as a person
  account is never proposed by the scan, by a rule or by a source.
- **Each lookup reads at most 5,000 related records.** If a source's values are so common
  that a lookup reaches that limit, some pairs are missed and a warning naming the source is
  written to the Error Log.

## Common Mistakes

**The panel says no duplicate rule is switched on, and the scan button is refused.** The scan
asks Salesforce to apply your active duplicate rules to the records you already have. With no
active rule there is nothing to apply, and reporting a clean database would be wrong. Choose
**Open Duplicate Rules in Setup**, open **Standard Contact Duplicate Rule** and **Standard
Account Duplicate Rule**, and choose **Activate** on each. This is the one Setup step, and only
orgs that switched the rules off need it.

**The scan finds nothing in a database you know has duplicates.** The standard rules match on
a similar name together with the same email, phone or address. People with no email, phone or
address match on nothing. Fill those in, or ask whoever manages your Salesforce to widen the
matching rule in Setup, and scan again.

**An organization pair never appears.** The panel shows people and households only. Merge
organizations with Salesforce's own tools. A scan checks households only when an account rule
that compares organizations and households is switched on; a person account rule alone does
not start that part of the scan.

**A pair of person accounts never appears either.** If your org stores people as person
accounts, merge two of them with Salesforce's own account merge. BarnCRM handles it as it
does a merge of two contacts: the kept person joins every household the other one belonged
to, each household keeps its primary member, an emptied household is kept, and the kept
person's totals are recalculated straight away.

**A Nonprofit Cloud household never appears.** In an org that also uses Salesforce Nonprofit
Cloud households, a household that is one of those is not suggested and cannot be merged here
or with **Merge or Split**: merging deletes one of the two records, and its Nonprofit Cloud
household group would be deleted or moved with it. Combine those with Nonprofit Cloud's own
tools.

**A person account is never paired with a contact.** Salesforce cannot merge the two, so such
a pair is not suggested.

**Scan for duplicates is greyed out.** A scan is already running, perhaps one a colleague
started. Wait for it to finish and choose **Refresh**. Two scans at once would suggest the
same pairs twice, so a second one is refused.

**A household pair should not be merged with the Salesforce merge.** Always merge households
from this panel or with **Merge or Split** on the household's record page. That merge moves
the members, recalculates the totals and renames the household, and lets you choose what to
keep. If two households are merged with Salesforce's own account merge anyway, BarnCRM recounts
and renames the kept household, settles its primary member and keeps one primary address within
a minute or so, in the background, because Salesforce does not let anything change the records
while it is merging them. If a person was in both households, they are left with one membership in the kept household (the primary one, or else the earlier start), so they are counted once. It cannot ask which name or members to keep, which is why the
household record page does not offer that merge.

**A merge run by another app or a background job.** The tidy-up after a Salesforce merge (one
membership per person, the count and name, one primary address, no relationship with oneself,
the primary affiliation) also runs when the merge was made by a background job, an
integration or a deduplication app. When the merge itself runs in the background, BarnCRM
asks for the tidy-up once the merge is saved, so it can take a minute or two longer. That
tidy-up runs as Salesforce's Automated Process user, so it shows as **Last Modified By** on the
addresses, relationships and memberships it changed. Only if
Salesforce refuses that request (for example, the org has used its daily allowance of
events) does the **Error Log** get a Warning, under the context "Tidy-up after a merge",
naming the kept records and the reason. Open each record named and correct it by hand.

**A colleague cannot find the panel, or sees it without buttons.** The **Review** area of the
**Duplicate Matching** tab needs BarnCRM Admin or BarnCRM Duplicate Review, and the tab
appears a minute or so after either is given. Scanning, dismissing and merging from it need
the Manage BarnCRM Settings permission, which the BarnCRM Admin permission set grants, and
access to duplicate record sets, which the BarnCRM Duplicate Review permission set grants.
Duplicates are no longer in **Org Optimizer**.

**The panel says suggestions need access to duplicate record sets.** The person
viewing it does not have BarnCRM Duplicate Review, or has a license that cannot have it.
Give them the permission set in BarnCRM Settings, **Access**, under **Extra Permissions** (see
How to turn it on). A Salesforce Platform user cannot
be given it at all; ask a colleague with a Sales Cloud or Service Cloud license to review.

**The last-scan line is red.** Salesforce refused to check some batches of up to 50 records, for
example because a duplicate rule was switched off during the scan, or could not save some
suggestions. The details are in the **Error Log**, under the context "Duplicate scan". Fix the
cause and scan again: pairs already found are not suggested twice.

**After merging two people, an empty household is left.** That is on purpose. Records made
while the other person lived there (with Giving, their gifts) still name that household. Until you merge it, Health Check
lists it under **Households have nobody in them**. Merge it into the kept person's household
from this panel or with **Merge or Split** on the household's page.

**You dismissed a pair and now want it back.** Dismissals are records. On the panel, choose
**View** next to **Dismissed suggestions**, pick the **All Duplicate Dismissals** list, find the pair
by its reason, and delete it. The next scan suggests that pair again. Anyone with BarnCRM
Admin can delete a dismissal, whoever made it: a dismissal is the organization's decision.
