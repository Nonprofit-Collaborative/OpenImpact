# BarnCRM Brand

Patch, the highland cow, is BarnCRM's mascot and logo (ADR-0224, Patch brand).

## Palette

| Name | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Barn Navy | `#1E2A3A` | App headers, text, buttons. White on it: 14.5:1. |
| Patch Rust | `#D35400` | Large or decorative accents only. White on it is 4.17:1, so never small text on rust or rust text on white. |
| Sage Green | `#8EB397` | The circle behind Patch in the logos. |
| Cream | `#F5F4EE` | Light backgrounds. Navy on it: 13.17:1. |
| Charcoal | `#2B2B2B` | Body text on cream: 12.85:1. |

BarnCRM screens use SLDS 2 styling hooks, not these colors (UX kit); status colors are SLDS's.

## Rules

- Never redraw, recolor, stretch or crop into Patch. Scale only, keeping the aspect ratio.
- A changed image needs a new ContentAsset name: an org keeps the old image under an old name.
- Alternative text names Patch, for example "Patch, the BarnCRM highland cow, waving hello".

## Masters

The cut-out masters live outside the repository, in the brand folder's `patch-assets/`:
`marks/`, `modules/`, `hires/` (1024 px), `poses/`, `contact-sheet.png` and `manifest.md`
(source and processing of each file). `scripts/brand/make-logos.py --source <patch-assets>`
rebuilds every packaged asset and the copies here from `hires/`.
