# Memberships

A **membership** is one term (a year, say) of one member at one **level**. A member is a person,
a household or an organization. When a member renews, BarnCRM adds the next term and marks the
old one Renewed, so each year's dates and payment stay as they were. Your BarnCRM admin sets up
the levels (see [Memberships](../admin-guide/memberships.md) in the Admin Guide).

## To Add a Member

1. Open the **BarnCRM Memberships** app (or **BarnCRM** or **BarnCRM Console**) and the
   **Memberships** tab, then click **New**.
2. Choose the **Level**, and the **Contact** (a person's own membership), the **Household or
   Organization**, or both (an organization member and the person you deal with).
3. Leave **Status** Current, or choose **Pending** for a member who will pay online.
4. Save. BarnCRM fills the dues from the level, a start date of today, the end date from the
   level's term, and **Member Since**.

## What the Status Means

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Pending | Not paid yet |
| Current | In its term |
| Grace | Ended, but still in the level's grace days |
| Lapsed | Ended and past the grace days |
| Renewed | A newer term follows it |
| Cancelled | Ended early, or its online payment was refunded |

BarnCRM moves ended memberships to Grace and then Lapsed each morning. A membership with no end
date never lapses.

## To Renew a Membership

1. Open the membership and click **Renew** in the membership panel.
2. Choose the level (the same one is chosen for you) and confirm.

The new term starts the day after the old one ends when it is Current or in Grace, or today when
it has lapsed. Gifts to your membership fund and online payments can renew memberships by
themselves; you do not need to renew those by hand.

## To Send a Payment Link

When your organization takes dues online, click **Email Payment Link** on the membership. The
member gets an email with a link to pay on Stripe's or PayPal's own page. The link works for about
a day; send a new one if it has stopped working. When the payment arrives (up to 15 minutes
later), BarnCRM dates the membership on it: a Pending membership becomes Current, and any other is
renewed.

## The Directory Listing

A member chooses whether they appear in your online member directory, from your member portal.
On the membership, **Listed in Directory**, **Directory Location** and **Directory Bio** show
what they chose. Change them only when the member asks you to.

## Certifications and Continuing Credits

When your organization certifies people (a trainer, a counselor, a docent), each person's
certification is a **Member Certification**, on the **Member Certifications** tab.

1. Click **New**, choose the **Certification** and the **Contact**, and save. It starts
   **Pending**.
2. When they qualify, press **Grant** in the **Certification** panel on the right. It becomes
   **Active** with an **Expires On** date.
3. Add each **Continuing Credit** they earn from the **Continuing Credits** list: the credits, the
   date, what earned them and the kind of activity. The panel shows the credits toward renewal.
4. When they have enough, press **Renew**. The certification runs for another period and those
   credits are marked **Used**. Until then the panel says how many more are needed.
5. **Revoke** ends a certification at once; **Grant** makes it Active again.

An Active certification past its Expires On becomes **Expired** the next morning. Renew it the
same way once the credits are in.
