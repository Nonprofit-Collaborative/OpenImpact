# Before You Test

Set up a test org once, then run the scripts in this guide against it. Everything here uses the
scripts in `scripts/org/`; for how they work, see
[Scratch orgs](../contributor-guide/scratch-orgs.md).

## Create a Test Org

> **Not for production orgs:** BarnCRM is in pilot. We do not recommend installing pilot or testing versions in a production Salesforce org. Use a scratch org, a sandbox or a free Developer Edition org.

You need the Salesforce CLI (`sf`), a Dev Hub connected to it, and a clean checkout of `main`
(see [Environment](../contributor-guide/environment.md)). Run every command from the
repository root.

Pick a shape. Run the smoke list on the Person Accounts shape; run the full regression list on
both shapes below before a release.

| Shape | Command | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| Person Accounts | `scripts/org/create-scratch-org.sh person-accounts <alias> --days 30 --no-sample-data` | The default. Closest to an Agentforce Nonprofit org; Opportunity and Campaign exist, so Mirror can be tested. |
| Platform only | `scripts/org/create-scratch-org.sh platform-only <alias> --days 30 --no-sample-data` | Proving Core and the modules work with no Sales or Service objects, and that every Core permission set fits a Salesforce Platform license (the script checks this itself). |

The other shapes (`sales-cloud`, `npsp`, `nonprofit-cloud`, `multi-currency`) exist in
`config/scratch-defs/`; use them only when a script asks for them. `nonprofit-cloud` needs an
entitled Dev Hub. Every Apex test runs on the Sales Cloud, Person Accounts, Platform-only and
NPSP shapes, and once per version on multi-currency, in the release gate
(`scripts/org/release-gate.sh`), so a script here need not repeat what those tests prove.

The script creates the org, deploys Core, gives your login user every Core permission set, and
prints the expiry date. A scratch org lasts at most 30 days. To start again from a clean org,
run the same command with `--replace`, which deletes the old org first.

`--no-sample-data` is deliberate: the sample data must be loaded after the modules are
deployed, or it loads without gifts or volunteer records (see [Load sample data](#load-sample-data)).

A sandbox of a real organization is different: it holds real people, so it never gets sample
data and never gets every module. Follow
[Core-only real-org sandbox](#core-only-real-org-sandbox) below instead of the scratch org
steps.

## Core-Only Real-Org Sandbox

For testing Core in a sandbox copy of a real nonprofit org (for example `mwdbdevsb`): Core
only, people stored as regular Contacts and Accounts (no Person Accounts), no sample data, and
real records that must not be erased or bulk-changed. The testers are System Administrators.
Do these in order.

1. **Deploy Core only.** `scripts/org/deploy-packages.sh <alias> --core-only`. Never run it
   without `--core-only`, and never run `create-scratch-org.sh`, `seed-sample-data.sh` or script
   T-SA-08. Skip the "Deploy the modules", "Load Sample Data" and "Test users" steps below.
   Core alone runs on Contacts and Accounts.
2. **Work in the BarnCRM apps.** The BarnCRM Contact and Account record pages apply only in the
   four BarnCRM apps (App Launcher, **BarnCRM**, **BarnCRM Console**, **BarnCRM Admin** or
   **BarnCRM Admin Console**). In any other app a record opens on the org's own page and steps
   that name a panel or action will not match. Open every record, **Contacts** and **Accounts**
   included, from a BarnCRM app; a script that says "the **BarnCRM** app" works the same in
   **BarnCRM Console**, and one that names a tool tab such as **BarnCRM Settings** means
   **BarnCRM Admin** or **BarnCRM Admin Console**. The new page layouts ship unassigned, and
   the shipped list views show everything the user can see (no "my records" filter), so expect
   the org's own layouts elsewhere and the full list in the BarnCRM list views.
3. **Hold these permission sets.** A System Administrator is not a BarnCRM Admin. Open
   **BarnCRM Settings**, **Access**, find yourself in **Find a person**, choose **BarnCRM
   Admin** and select **Give Access** (see [Access](../admin-guide/access.md)). That role
   already carries Find and Export and Bulk Update. Add these under **Extra Permissions** only
   while a script needs them, and remove them afterwards:

   | Extra permission | Give it for | Remove it |
   |---|---|---|
   | BarnCRM Duplicate Review | T-DUP scripts, smoke item 13 | When the duplicate scripts are done |
   | BarnCRM Erase People | T-ERASE-01 and T-ERASE-02, smoke item 15, on fixture records only | Straight after that script |
   | BarnCRM Metadata Admin | Only for a test user who is not a BarnCRM Admin and must save custom metadata (BarnCRM Admin already includes it) | When those are done |
   | BarnCRM Bulk Delete | The delete scripts in [Super Transformer and bulk delete](bulk-update-and-delete.md), on `Bulkdeltest` contacts only | Straight after |

4. **First-run setup and the household catch-up.** The setup window (T-SA-01) shows to every
   user until someone with **Manage BarnCRM Settings** finishes it, and only that person gets
   **Finish Setup**; everyone else sees "An administrator needs to finish setting up
   BarnCRM." Core was deployed to `mwdbdevsb` once before, so open **BarnCRM Settings**,
   **General** first: if no window shows, setup is finished and T-SA-01 is Skipped.
   **Warning:** turning **Households** on (in first-run setup or in **General**) queues a
   background catch-up that gives a household to existing contacts that have none, on real
   records. That is a bulk change to real data. Decide before you finish setup or switch it on;
   the household scripts need it on, so run them only in a sandbox you can refresh.
5. **Create the fixture records first.** Scripts that say Garcia use records that exist only
   in sample data. Create these instead, all with the test prefix **Zztest**, so nothing
   touches a real person and a search for the prefix finds only them:

   | Record | Create |
   |---|---|
   | Contact | **Harper Zztest**, email `harper.zztest1@example.org`, no account (this makes the household **The Zztest Family**) |
   | Contact | **Luis Zztest**, added with **Add Member** on The Zztest Family's **Members** panel; then edit the contact and set email `luis.zztest2@example.org` |
   | Contact | **Diego Zztest**, added with **Add Member** the same way |
   | Address | On The Zztest Family, **Add Address** on the **Addresses** card: Type **Home**, `6830 Sunset Ln`, Springfield, IL, 62756, United States |

   The household then reads **3** members. **Wherever a
   script says Garcia, read Zztest**: The Garcia Family is The Zztest Family,
   `harper.garcia1@example.org` is `harper.zztest1@example.org`, and a Find or Super Transformer
   condition **Last Name equals Garcia** is **Last Name equals Zztest**. With the fixture in
   place, T-IMP-01 gives the counts it states (3 created, 0 updated, 1 matched, 1 rejected);
   without Harper they would be 4, 0, 0, 1. Test emails use `example.org`, so none matches a
   real person.
6. **Check the count before anything bulk.** Before a Super Transformer run, a bulk delete, an import
   or an erase, the preview must name only fixture records: a Super Transformer run on `Zztest` shows 3
   records, a bulk delete on `Bulkdeltest` shows 3, an import shows only the rows in the
   test file. If it shows more, cancel and fix the condition. Never use a condition that can
   match a real person, and never choose a real record in a merge, move, erase or relationship
   step.
7. **Scripts to skip** (record Skipped, "Core-only real-org sandbox"): every script on the
   Giving, Mirror (Mirror and Mirror for Giving), Volunteers and Rollup Builder pages; T-SA-02 (needs a fresh org) and T-SA-07
   to T-SA-09 (sample data); T-HH-14 (needs a person account); and the whole smoke list from
   item 16 on. Run smoke items 1 to 15 ([Smoke list](README.md#smoke-list-every-build-about-one-hour)).
   On the full list, skip any other step that names sample data or a module; do not change real
   records to make it work.
8. **Clean up at the end.** Delete only what you created, one record at a time: search for
   `Zztest`, `Testwell`, `Bulkdeltest`, `Erasetest`, and the import people (Testa Rivera, Ben
   Okoro, Cara Lind, Dee Nolast; undoing the import in T-IMP-03 removes them). Remove every
   extra permission you gave and put back any setting you changed. If a record that is not
   yours changed, record it in the issue and refresh the sandbox.

## Deploy the Modules

`create-scratch-org.sh` deploys Core only. To deploy every module (Rollup Builder, Giving,
Volunteers, Mirror, Mirror for Giving and the rest) on top:

```bash
scripts/org/deploy-packages.sh <alias>
```

Then give your login user the module admin permission sets:

```bash
sf org assign permset --target-org <alias> --name Rollup_Builder_Admin --name Giving_Admin --name Volunteers_Admin --name Salesforce_Records_Sync --name Accounting_Export --name Inbound_Gifts --name Provider_Requests
```

To test Core alone (the Standard Edition with nothing else installed), skip this step and use a
separate org. In a real-org sandbox, never run it: follow
[Core-only real-org sandbox](#core-only-real-org-sandbox).

## Load Sample Data

Scratch orgs only. Never in a real-org sandbox: use the fixture in
[Core-only real-org sandbox](#core-only-real-org-sandbox).

```bash
scripts/org/seed-sample-data.sh <alias>
```

It loads 200 households, their contacts, 25 organizations, connections and affiliations, and,
with the modules deployed, gifts, funds, appeals, commitments and volunteer records. It waits
until every background job has finished, which takes a few minutes with Giving installed.
Loading twice is refused; remove the set first (script T-SA-07 in
[Setup Assistant](setup-assistant.md) covers removal through the app).

Then, with Giving installed, open **BarnCRM Settings**, **Rollups**, and select
**Recalculate**, so giving totals are filled in before you test them.

Sample data detail and the names in it (for example **The Garcia Family** and the **Staff
Household**): [Sample data](../admin-guide/sample-data.md).

## Test Users

Run each script as the user its **Prerequisites** line names. Your login user is the
**admin**. Create the other two once per org.

| User | Role in the app | Permission sets it ends up with |
|---|---|---|
| admin | Your login user (System Administrator) | BarnCRM Admin and every Core set (from the create script), plus the module sets above |
| staff | **Team Member** role, plus the **Giving Staff** extra permission (or the **Fundraising Staff** role instead) | BarnCRM Staff, Giving Staff, Volunteers Staff (follows the role) |
| read-only | **Read Only** role, plus the **Giving Read Only** extra permission | BarnCRM Read Only, Giving Read Only, Volunteers Read Only (follows the role) |

In a real-org sandbox, skip this section: the testers are the two System Administrators, who
run the scripts as themselves ([Core-only real-org sandbox](#core-only-real-org-sandbox)).
Scripts that need a staff or read-only user are Skipped there, unless you create the user in
Setup as step 1 describes and the owner agrees.

Steps:

1. Create the two users. On a scratch org use the CLI commands below. In a sandbox, which the
   CLI cannot create users in, go to Setup, **Users**, **New User**, with the same profiles and
   an email you control, then give the **Team Member** role (staff) or **Read Only** role
   (read-only) on the **Access** page in step 2. Give staff the **Standard User** profile (on the
   platform-only shape, **Standard Platform User**). Give read-only the Salesforce **Read Only**
   profile: a profile that can edit accounts and contacts would override the BarnCRM Read Only
   set, and the read-only negative scripts would wrongly pass.

   ```bash
   sf org create user --target-org <alias> --set-alias <alias>-staff profileName="Standard User" LastName="Staff Tester" Username="staff@<alias>.barncrm.test" Email="staff@<alias>.barncrm.test"
   sf org create user --target-org <alias> --set-alias <alias>-ro profileName="Read Only" LastName="Read Only Tester" Username="readonly@<alias>.barncrm.test" Email="readonly@<alias>.barncrm.test"
   ```

2. Give the roles in the app, which also tests the Access page: open **BarnCRM Settings**,
   **Access**, find each user in **Find a person**, choose the role, and select **Give Access**.
   Add the Giving set under the extra permissions on the same page. The Volunteers and Rollup
   Builder sets are not listed there: they follow the role, given automatically when the role
   is given on this page (and by the hourly access check). See
   [Access](../admin-guide/access.md).

   Or assign the permission sets from the CLI. This assigns the sets directly rather than the
   role, so name the Volunteers set too:

   ```bash
   sf org assign permset --target-org <alias> --on-behalf-of staff@<alias>.barncrm.test --name BarnCRM_Staff --name Giving_Staff --name Volunteers_Staff
   sf org assign permset --target-org <alias> --on-behalf-of readonly@<alias>.barncrm.test --name BarnCRM_Read_Only --name Giving_Read_Only --name Volunteers_Read_Only
   ```

3. Log in as a test user: `sf org open --target-org <alias>-staff` (or `<alias>-ro`). Use a
   private browser window for each user so sessions do not mix. To get a password instead,
   run `sf org generate password --target-org <alias> --on-behalf-of <username>`.

Feature permission sets (**BarnCRM Bulk Update**, **BarnCRM Bulk Delete**, **BarnCRM Erase
People**, **BarnCRM Duplicate Review** and the rest) are given to the staff and read-only users
only when a script says so. Many negative scripts depend on those users not having them. The
admin already holds every Core set, these included, because the create script assigns them all:
that is more than a real BarnCRM Admin holds, so test a permission's absence with the staff
user, never the admin.

The create script has no switch to leave sets off: the gate needs them all. To test what an
admin sees without a feature set (for example a BarnCRM Admin who cannot erase people or review
duplicates), use one of these:

- **A second admin user (preferred).** Create a third user as in step 1 with the **System
  Administrator** profile, then give it only the **BarnCRM Admin** role on the Access page.
  It holds what a real BarnCRM Admin holds and none of the extra permissions. Give it one extra
  permission at a time when a script needs it.
- **Your login user, for one script.** On the Access page, under **Extra Permissions**, select
  **Remove** beside your name for the set you are testing, run the script, then give it back.
  Sets not listed there (BarnCRM Access Manager and the tab sets) are removed in Setup, Users,
  your user, **Permission Set Assignments**, and added back the same way.

## Edition Modes

BarnCRM has two editions: the **Standard Edition** (Core, no nonprofit modules offered) and the
**Nonprofit Edition** (Core plus Giving and the other nonprofit modules). The edition is chosen
once, in the first-run setup window, and decides what BarnCRM shows and offers; it never
installs or removes anything. See [Editions](../admin-guide/editions.md).

- Most scripts assume the **Nonprofit Edition**. Choose it the first time you open the app
  (script T-SA-01 in [Setup Assistant](setup-assistant.md)).
- Scripts that check what the Standard Edition hides say so in their prerequisites. Switch with
  **BarnCRM Settings**, **General**, **Edition**, **Change Edition**, and switch back afterwards.

## Record Results

Copy this table into a file or spreadsheet per test run. One row per script.

```text
Build: main at <short sha>    Org: <alias>, shape <shape>    Tester: <name>    Date: <yyyy-mm-dd>

| Script | Result (Pass / Fail / Blocked / Skipped) | Failed step | Issue | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-HH-01 | Pass | | | |
| T-IMP-03 | Fail | 4 | #NNN | Undo left 2 contacts |
```

- **Pass**: every step's expected result happened.
- **Fail**: a step's result differed. Record the first failing step and stop that script.
- **Blocked**: a prerequisite failed (for example the org would not deploy), so the script could
  not run.
- **Skipped**: not run this time, with the reason.

Get the short sha with `git rev-parse --short HEAD` on the checkout you deployed.

## Report a Failure

Report bugs and give feedback through GitHub: open
<https://github.com/Nonprofit-Collaborative/BarnCRM/issues/new/choose> and choose the **Bug
report** template (or the feature request template for feedback). [SUPPORT.md](../../SUPPORT.md)
says what to include. Fill the bug report in like this:

- **What Happened**: the actual result, word for word where there is a message. Add a
  screenshot.
- **What you expected**: the expected result from the script.
- **Steps to reproduce**: the script ID and failing step number (for example "T-GIFT-04, step
  6"), plus any data you entered that differs from the script.
- **Org shape**: Person Accounts is "Agentforce Nonprofit or Person Accounts"; platform-only is
  "Platform only".
- **BarnCRM version**: no package version exists yet, so write `main at <short sha>`.
- **Module**: the package the script tests. Rollup Builder is not in the list: choose "Not
  sure" and name it in the description.
- **Error Log message**: if the app showed an error, open **BarnCRM Settings**, **Error Log**,
  and copy the newest entry. See [Error log](../admin-guide/error-log.md).

Never put donor or other personal data in an issue, a screenshot or an attachment: scratch
orgs hold sample data only, so copy from those. In a real-org sandbox quote only your `Zztest`
fixture records, never a real person. Report a security problem privately, as
[SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) describes, never in a public issue.
