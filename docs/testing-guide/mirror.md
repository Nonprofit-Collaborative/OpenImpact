# Mirror

Scripts for the two Mirror packages. **BarnCRM Mirror for Giving** holds Campaign sync, the Opportunity mirror, the accounting export, the Inbound Gift API, the Record Inbound Gift action and the Gift Transaction mirror (T-MIR-01 to T-MIR-15). **BarnCRM Mirror**, which needs only Core, holds Cases sent to a service provider (T-MIR-16 to T-MIR-18). Setup detail: [Cases Sent to a Service Provider](../admin-guide/mirror-case-requests.md), [Campaign Sync](../admin-guide/campaign-sync.md), [Opportunity Mirror](../admin-guide/opportunity-mirror.md), [Accounting Export](../admin-guide/accounting-export.md), [Inbound Gift API](../admin-guide/inbound-gift-api.md), [Gift Transaction Mirror](../admin-guide/gift-transaction-mirror.md).

Before you start: an org from [Before you test](before-you-test.md), with Core, Giving, Mirror and Mirror for Giving deployed and sample data loaded unless a script says otherwise. Campaign sync and the Opportunity mirror need Opportunity and Campaign, so use the Person Accounts (or `sales-cloud`) shape, not platform-only: see [Create a test org](before-you-test.md#create-a-test-org). The Gift Transaction mirror needs Nonprofit Cloud fundraising for T-MIR-15; T-MIR-14 runs in any org. Each Mirror feature has its own permission set (**Campaign Sync**, **Opportunity Mirror**, **Accounting Export**, **Inbound Gift API**, **Record Inbound Gift Action**, **Gift Transaction Mirror**). No role includes them, and the admin user does not have them until a script gives them: open **BarnCRM Settings**, **Access**, find the person, and use **Extra Permissions**, **Give Permission**.

## T-MIR-01: Switch on Campaign Sync and Sync All Appeals

**Purpose:** confirm the switch, the counts and Sync all appeals give every sample appeal a Campaign.
**Prerequisites:** admin, with the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set and **Marketing User** ticked on your user (Setup, Users, your user, Edit). Sample data (7 appeals).
**Smoke:** yes

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **BarnCRM Settings**, **Giving**, and open **Campaign Sync**. | The **Campaign Sync** card says `Campaign sync is off. Switch on Copy appeals to Campaigns in the Giving section of BarnCRM Settings, then come back to sync your appeals.` No **Sync All Appeals** button shows. |
| 2 | In **Giving**, tick **Copy appeals to campaigns** and save. | The setting saves. |
| 3 | Open **Campaign Sync** again. | `Campaign sync is on. Saving an appeal creates or updates its Campaign.` and `0 of 7 appeals have a Campaign.` **Sync All Appeals** is enabled. |
| 4 | Click **Sync All Appeals**. | `Sync all appeals is running in the background. Reload this page in a minute to see new counts. Anything that could not be copied is in the Error Log.` |
| 5 | Wait a minute and reload the page. | `7 of 7 appeals have a Campaign.` |
| 6 | Open the App Launcher, search **Campaigns**, and open the list. | Seven Campaigns named after the appeals. **Spring Appeal** shows **Annual Fund** as its Parent Campaign. |
| 7 | Open the **Appeals** tab and choose the **Appeals and Their Campaigns** list view. | Every appeal has a **Campaign ID** starting `701`. |

**Cleanup:** None (later scripts use these Campaigns).

## T-MIR-02: Appeal Changes Reach the Campaign, One Way Only

**Purpose:** confirm saving an appeal creates and updates its Campaign, nothing comes back, and a bad Campaign ID is refused.
**Prerequisites:** admin, as in T-MIR-01, with Campaign sync on.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On the **Appeals** tab, click **New**. Name `Giving Tuesday`, **Goal** 5,000, a start date of today. Save. | The appeal saves. |
| 2 | Open the Campaigns list and open `Giving Tuesday`. | Expected Revenue 5,000, start date today. |
| 3 | On the appeal, change **Goal** to 7,500 and save. Reload the Campaign. | Expected Revenue is 7,500. |
| 4 | Create appeal `Giving Tuesday: matching challenge` with **Parent Appeal** `Giving Tuesday`. Open its Campaign. | Parent Campaign is `Giving Tuesday`. |
| 5 | On the `Giving Tuesday` Campaign, change its Description and save. Open the appeal. | The appeal's description is unchanged. |
| 6 | In **Appeals and Their Campaigns**, double-click the **Campaign ID** cell of `Giving Tuesday: matching challenge`, enter `abc`, and save. | The save is refused with `Campaign ID must be the record ID of a Campaign (18 characters, starting 701), or empty.` |
| 7 | Paste the **Campaign ID** of `Giving Tuesday` into the same cell and save. | The save fails with a duplicate value error. Both appeals keep their own Campaign ID. |

**Cleanup:** None. Campaign sync never deletes a Campaign; delete the two Campaigns and appeals by hand if you want them gone.

## T-MIR-03: Campaign Sync Access and Switching Off

**Purpose:** confirm who cannot sync, and that switching off stops copying and deletes nothing.
**Prerequisites:** staff given the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set (Marketing User not ticked); read-only; admin. Campaign sync on.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As read-only, open the App Launcher and search `Campaign Sync`. | No **Campaign Sync** item is found. |
| 2 | As staff, open the **Campaign Sync** tab from the App Launcher. | The card shows `You cannot create and edit Campaigns, so appeals you save get no Campaign...` and `Only someone with the Manage BarnCRM Settings permission can sync all appeals.` **Sync All Appeals** is disabled. |
| 3 | As admin, in **BarnCRM Settings**, **Giving**, untick **Copy appeals to campaigns** and save. | The setting saves. |
| 4 | Change the **Goal** of `Giving Tuesday` to 9,000 and save. Reload its Campaign. | Expected Revenue is still 7,500. Every Campaign is still there. |
| 5 | Tick **Copy appeals to campaigns** again and save `Giving Tuesday` once more. | The Campaign's Expected Revenue is 9,000. |

**Cleanup:** remove the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set from staff.

## T-MIR-04: Opportunity Mirror, Gifts to Opportunities

**Purpose:** confirm a run gives every gift in the totals an Opportunity and the reconciliation agrees.
**Prerequisites:** admin, with the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set. Sample data, with rollups recalculated.
**Smoke:** yes

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open the App Launcher and the **Opportunity Mirror** tab. | `The Opportunity mirror is off. Choose a direction in BarnCRM Settings, Giving, Opportunity mirror direction.` |
| 2 | In **BarnCRM Settings**, **Giving**, set **Opportunity mirror direction** to **Gifts to Opportunities** and save. | The setting saves. |
| 3 | Reopen **Opportunity Mirror**. | `Direction: Gifts to Opportunities. Every gift in the totals gets a matching Opportunity.`, `The nightly run is not scheduled.` and `No run has completed yet.` |
| 4 | Click **Run Now**. | `The run has started. Its summary is written to the Error Log when it ends.` |
| 5 | Wait a minute and reload. | The last run line reads `Last completed run: started <time>. Opportunity mirror run, Gifts to Opportunities: <n> Opportunities created, 0 updated, ...` |
| 6 | Under **Reconciliation**, set **From** to 1 January of this year and **To** to today. Click **Compare**. | `Gifts: <n>, total <amount>` and `Won Opportunities: <n>, total <amount>` show the same count and total, and `No differences.` |
| 7 | Record a gift of 100 from Luis Garcia on the **Quick Gift Entry** tab. Open the newest Opportunity from the App Launcher. | Amount 100, Stage Closed Won, Close Date today, Luis Garcia as primary contact. |
| 8 | Change the gift's amount to 150 and save. Reload the Opportunity. | Amount 150. |

**Cleanup:** None (T-MIR-05 continues from here).

## T-MIR-05: Reconciliation Differences and Repair

**Purpose:** confirm a hand-changed Opportunity is listed and **Copy these gifts again** repairs it; a bad Opportunity ID is refused.
**Prerequisites:** admin, after T-MIR-04.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On Luis Garcia's 150 Opportunity, change Amount to 175 and save. | Saved. |
| 2 | On **Opportunity Mirror**, click **Compare** for this year. | `Differences found: 1. All are listed.` The table row shows **Gift Amount** 150, **Opportunity Amount** 175, **Difference** `Amount differs`. **Copy these gifts again** shows. |
| 3 | Click **Copy these gifts again**, wait, and click **Compare**. | `No differences.` The Opportunity's Amount is 150. |
| 4 | Clear both dates and click **Compare**. | `Choose a start date and an end date.` |
| 5 | Set **From** after **To** and click **Compare**. | `The start date must be on or before the end date.` |
| 6 | On the **Gifts** tab, choose **Gifts and Their Opportunities**. Double-click a gift's **Opportunity ID**, enter `abc`, and save. | Refused with `Opportunity ID must be the record ID of an Opportunity (18 characters, starting 006), or empty.` |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-MIR-06: Opportunities to Gifts, Start Date and the Nightly Run

**Purpose:** confirm a won Opportunity becomes a gift only after the start date, and the nightly run can be scheduled and stopped.
**Prerequisites:** admin, with the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In **Giving**, set **Opportunity mirror direction** to **Opportunities to Gifts**, leave **Opportunity mirror start date** empty, save, and open **Opportunity Mirror**. | `Direction: Opportunities to Gifts, but no start date is set, so no Opportunity becomes a gift. Set Opportunity mirror start date in BarnCRM Settings.` |
| 2 | Set **Opportunity mirror start date** to today and save. Reopen the page. | `Direction: Opportunities to Gifts. Won Opportunities closed on or after <today> become gifts.` |
| 3 | Create a won Opportunity of 60, closed today, with Luis Garcia's account and Luis as primary contact. Click **Run Now** and wait a minute. | A gift of 60 appears on Luis Garcia's record. In **Gifts and Their Opportunities** its **Opportunity ID** names that Opportunity. |
| 4 | Create a won Opportunity of 80 closed last month and click **Run Now**. | No gift of 80 is made. |
| 5 | Click **Schedule Nightly Run**. | `Next nightly run: <date> 1:30 AM`. The button changes to **Stop Nightly Run**. The mirror is now a switched-on step of [BarnCRM Nightly Jobs](../admin-guide/nightly-jobs.md), the one nightly run. |
| 6 | Click **Stop Nightly Run** (undo). | `The nightly run is not scheduled.` The button changes back to **Schedule Nightly Run**. |

**Cleanup:** set **Opportunity mirror direction** to **Off**; delete the 60 gift and the two Opportunities.

## T-MIR-07: Opportunity Mirror Access

**Purpose:** confirm the page and run buttons are closed to people without the permission set or Manage BarnCRM Settings.
**Prerequisites:** read-only; staff given the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set. Direction **Gifts to Opportunities**.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As read-only, search the App Launcher for `Opportunity Mirror`. | No **Opportunity Mirror** item is found. |
| 2 | As staff, open the **Opportunity Mirror** tab. | `Starting or scheduling the mirror needs the Manage BarnCRM Settings permission.` **Run Now** and **Schedule Nightly Run** are disabled. |
| 3 | As staff, run **Compare** for this year. | The comparison shows, limited to what staff can see. |

**Cleanup:** remove the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set from staff; set the direction to **Off**.

## T-MIR-08: Download the Accounting Export

**Purpose:** confirm the CSV downloads with the fixed columns, filters by fund and method, and an empty range gives no file.
**Prerequisites:** admin, with the **Accounting Export** permission set. Sample data.
**Smoke:** yes

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open the App Launcher and the **Accounting Export** tab. | **Accounting Export** card with **From**, **To**, **Fund** (placeholder **All funds**), **Payment Method** (**All payment methods**), **Only gifts not yet posted** and **Download File**. |
| 2 | Set **From** and **To** to the first and last day of last month. Click **Download File**. | `accounting-export-<from>-to-<to>.csv` downloads. The page says `<rows> rows from <gifts> gifts. Net total <amount>.` |
| 3 | Open the file. | Header row: `Date,Gift Number,Original Gift,Donor,Fund,Accounting Code,Payment Method,Reference,Amount`. Every date is in the range, and Amount adds up to the net total. |
| 4 | Choose **Building Fund** in **Fund** and download. | Every row says Building Fund, accounting code 4100. |
| 5 | Also choose **Check** in **Payment Method** and download. | Only Check rows to Building Fund remain (or `No gifts in this range.`). |
| 6 | Set a week next year and download. | No file. `No gifts in this range.` |
| 7 | Clear **From** and click **Download File**. | `Choose a From date and a To date.` |
| 8 | Set **To** before **From** and download. | `The To date is before the From date.` |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-MIR-09: Mark Gifts Posted, and Unpost One

**Purpose:** confirm marking posted locks the gifts, Only gifts not yet posted leaves them out, and Unpost reverses one.
**Prerequisites:** admin, with the **Accounting Export** permission set. Last month's range from T-MIR-08.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Choose **Building Fund** and download last month. | `To mark gifts posted, download the export for all funds: a gift split across funds would be locked when only part of it is in this file.` No **Mark These Gifts Posted** button. |
| 2 | Clear **Fund** and download again. | **Mark These Gifts Posted** shows, with `Once this file is in your accounting system, mark its gifts posted. A posted gift cannot be changed or deleted.` |
| 3 | Click **Mark These Gifts Posted**. | `Marked <n> gifts posted. Gifts already posted were left as they were.` The button goes away. |
| 4 | Open one gift from the file and change its amount. | Refused: `This gift has been posted to accounting, so its date, amount, donor, payment method, reference and funds cannot change and it cannot be deleted...` |
| 5 | Tick **Only gifts not yet posted** and download last month. | `No gifts in this range.` |
| 6 | On that gift's **Posting** card, enter a reason in **Why is this gift being unposted?** and click **Unpost** (undo). | A green notice: `Unposted. The reason is in the Error Log. After your next export, choose Mark These Gifts Posted on the Accounting Export page to post it again.` |
| 7 | Download last month again with **Only gifts not yet posted** ticked. | The file holds that one gift's rows. |

**Cleanup:** None (posted flags are harmless to later scripts; unpost more gifts the same way if needed).

## T-MIR-10: Accounting Export Access

**Purpose:** confirm only holders of the permission set reach the export.
**Prerequisites:** read-only; staff.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As read-only, search the App Launcher for `Accounting Export`. | No **Accounting Export** item is found. |
| 2 | As staff, do the same. | No **Accounting Export** item is found. |
| 3 | As admin, give staff **Accounting Export**. As staff, open the tab and download last month. | A file downloads, holding only the gifts staff can see. **Mark These Gifts Posted** shows, because the set includes Post Gifts. |
| 4 | As admin, create a user with no BarnCRM role and give them only **Accounting Export**; make them the owner of one of last month's gifts. As that user, open the tab and download last month. | A file downloads holding that gift, with its date, fund, accounting code, amount and donor name: no Giving set is needed beside Accounting Export. |

**Cleanup:** remove **Accounting Export** from staff and deactivate the user from step 4.

## T-MIR-11: Inbound Gift API, Record and Resend

**Purpose:** confirm the REST endpoint records a gift once and refuses a changed resend.
**Prerequisites:** an API user: `sf org create user --target-org <alias> --set-alias <alias>-api profileName="Standard User" LastName="API Tester" Username="api@<alias>.barncrm.test" Email="api@<alias>.barncrm.test"`, then `sf org assign permset --target-org <alias> --on-behalf-of api@<alias>.barncrm.test --name Inbound_Gifts`. Sample data. Endpoint in a test org: `/services/apexrest/v1/gifts`.
**Smoke:** yes

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run `sf api request rest /services/apexrest/v1/gifts --method POST --include --target-org <alias>-api --body '{"externalId":"test:api-1","amount":25,"paymentMethod":"Card","donorEmail":"luis.garcia2@example.org","fundCode":"4100"}'` | HTTP 201. Body `"outcome":"created"`, a `giftId`, `"message":"Gift recorded."` |
| 2 | Run the same command again. | HTTP 200. `"outcome":"existing"`, the same `giftId`, `"message":"This gift was already recorded. Nothing was changed."` |
| 3 | Run it again with `"amount":30`. | HTTP 409. `"errorCode":"external_id_conflict"`, `"message":"A gift with this externalId is already recorded with a different amount. Nothing was changed."` |
| 4 | As admin, open the gift by its `giftId`. | Luis Garcia, 25.00, type Card, today, one allocation to Building Fund. |

If step 1 answers `donor_not_found`, the API user cannot see contacts: see [Inbound Gift API](../admin-guide/inbound-gift-api.md).

**Cleanup:** delete the gift as admin.

## T-MIR-12: Inbound Gift API Refusals

**Purpose:** confirm bad requests are refused with the documented code and message, logged, and that a user without the set is turned away.
**Prerequisites:** the API user from T-MIR-11; read-only. Use the step 1 command of T-MIR-11 with the body shown.

| Step | Body or action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `{"externalId":"test:api-2","amount":-5,"paymentMethod":"Card","donorEmail":"luis.garcia2@example.org"}` | HTTP 400. `invalid_field`, `amount must be greater than zero, with at most two decimal places.` |
| 2 | `{"externalId":"test:api-3","amount":5,"paymentMethod":"Card"}` | HTTP 400. `invalid_field`, `Name the donor with donorId or donorEmail.` |
| 3 | `{"externalId":"test:api-4","amount":5,"paymentMethod":"Card","donorEmail":"nobody@example.org"}` | HTTP 422. `donor_not_found`, `No person has this donorEmail. Add the donor first, then send the gift again.` |
| 4 | `{"externalId":"test:api-5","amount":5,"paymentMethod":"Bitcoin","donorEmail":"luis.garcia2@example.org"}` | HTTP 400. `invalid_field`, message starts `paymentMethod must be one of:` |
| 5 | `{"externalId":"test:api-6","amount":5,"paymentMethod":"Card","donorEmail":"luis.garcia2@example.org","fundCode":"9999"}` | HTTP 422. `fund_not_found`, `No active fund matches fundId or fundCode.` |
| 6 | `not json` | HTTP 400. `invalid_request`, message starts `The request body is not a gift this API reads:` |
| 7 | As admin, open the **Error Log** tab. | Warnings such as `Inbound gift test:api-4 was refused (donor_not_found)...`, one per refusal. |
| 8 | Send the T-MIR-11 body with `--target-org <alias>-ro`. | HTTP 403 from Salesforce. No gift is recorded. |

**Cleanup:** None (nothing was recorded).

## T-MIR-13: Record Inbound Gift Action in Flow

**Purpose:** confirm the Flow action records, recognizes a resend and refuses an unknown donor.
**Prerequisites:** admin, with the **Inbound Gifts** permission set. Sample data.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Setup, **Flows**, **New Flow**, **Autolaunched Flow (No Trigger)**. Add an **Action**, search `Record Inbound Gift`, pick it. | The action shows inputs **External Id**, **Amount**, **Payment Method**, **Gift Date**, **Payment Reference**, **Donor Id**, **Donor Email**, **Fund Accounting Code**, **Fund Id**, **Appeal Id**. |
| 2 | Set **External Id** `test:flow-1`, **Amount** 25, **Payment Method** `Card`, **Donor Email** `luis.garcia2@example.org`, **Fund Accounting Code** `4100`. **Debug**, **Run**. | Result: **Outcome** `created`, a **Gift Id**, **Message** `Gift recorded.` |
| 3 | **Debug**, **Run** again. | **Outcome** `existing`, same **Gift Id**. |
| 4 | Change **Donor Email** to `nobody@example.org` and **External Id** to `test:flow-2`. Run. | **Outcome** `rejected`, **Error Code** `donor_not_found`. |

**Cleanup:** close the flow without activating it; delete the `test:flow-1` gift.

## T-MIR-14: Gift Transaction Mirror Without Nonprofit Cloud

**Purpose:** confirm the Gift Transaction mirror stays out of the way in an org without Nonprofit Cloud, and its page is closed to people without the permission set.
**Prerequisites:** admin, in any org without Nonprofit Cloud fundraising; staff without the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As admin, give yourself the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set, then open **BarnCRM Settings**, **Giving**. | **Gift Transaction mirror direction** shows **Off**, **Gift Transaction mirror paid status** shows `Paid`, and **Gift Transaction mirror start date** is empty with `Not set` under it. |
| 2 | Open **Gift Transaction Mirror** from **Giving**. | `This org has no Nonprofit Cloud Gift Transactions you can use, so there is nothing to mirror. ...` No run buttons and no **Reconciliation** section. |
| 3 | Set the direction to **Gifts to Gift Transactions**, the start date to today, and save. Record a gift of 25 from Luis Garcia on **Quick Gift Entry**. | The gift saves as usual. The page still says the mirror is not available, and the **Error Log** has no Gift Transaction mirror entry. |
| 4 | On the **Gifts** tab, choose **Gifts and Their Gift Transactions**, type `abc` into a gift's **Gift Transaction ID** and save. | Saved: without Gift Transactions nothing is checked. Clear the value again. |
| 5 | As staff, search the App Launcher for `Gift Transaction Mirror`. | No **Gift Transaction Mirror** item is found. |

**Cleanup:** set the direction to **Off**, clear the start date, delete the 25 gift, and remove the permission set.

## T-MIR-15: Gift Transaction Mirror With Nonprofit Cloud

**Purpose:** confirm a run copies gifts and their designations to Gift Transactions, keeps them up to date, and the reconciliation agrees.
**Prerequisites:** admin with the Fundraising User permission and the **Salesforce Records Sync** permission set, in an org with Nonprofit Cloud fundraising, at least one Gift Designation, and sample data.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In **Giving**, set **Gift Transaction mirror paid status** to a value that is not a Status of your Gift Transactions, the start date to the first of this month, the direction to **Gifts to Gift Transactions**, and save. Open **Gift Transaction Mirror**. | `The Gift Transaction mirror paid status, <value>, is not one of the active Status values ...` **Run Now** is disabled. |
| 2 | Set the paid status back to your paid value (`Paid` in a standard org; in an org with Nonprofit Cloud it is a dropdown of the active Status values, and a saved value Setup has since retired still shows in it) and reopen the page. | `Direction: Gifts to Gift Transactions. Received gifts dated on or after <date> get a matching Gift Transaction with status <value>.` |
| 3 | On the **Funds** tab, choose **Funds and Their Gift Designations** and paste a Gift Designation's record ID into the default fund's **Gift Designation ID**. | Saved. |
| 4 | Record a gift of 100 from Luis Garcia on **Quick Gift Entry**, dated today. On the page click **Run Now**, wait a minute and reload. | `Last completed run: started <time>. Gift Transaction mirror run: <n> Gift Transactions created, ...` with at least one designation written. The gift's **Gift Transaction ID** is filled in; that Gift Transaction has Original Amount 100, Transaction Date today and one designation of 100. |
| 5 | Change the gift's amount to 150, click **Run Now**, wait and reload the Gift Transaction. | Original Amount 150. The designation is unchanged. |
| 6 | Under **Reconciliation**, choose this month and click **Compare**. | Both sides show the same count and total, apart from Gift Transactions your org already had, listed as `Paid Gift Transaction with no received gift visible to you`. |
| 7 | Change the Gift Transaction's Original Amount to 175 in Nonprofit Cloud, then **Compare** again. | The gift is listed with `Amount differs`, and **Copy These Gifts Again** shows. Click it, wait, and **Compare**: the difference is gone. |
| 8 | Click **Schedule Nightly Run**, then **Stop Nightly Run**. | `Next nightly run: <date> 1:35 AM`, then `The nightly run is not scheduled.` |

**Cleanup:** set the direction to **Off**; delete the 150 gift (its Gift Transaction stays, and the Error Log has one Warning naming it) and delete that Gift Transaction in Nonprofit Cloud.

## T-MIR-16: Cases Sent to a Service Provider

**Purpose:** confirm the Case bridge, R-PR1 and R-PR2 (D-201).
**Prerequisites:** a provider org with Project Management, T-PM-33's Request Connection naming
this org's id, and the client credentials it gave; in this org, the `Barn_Request_Provider`
Named Credential set up as in the admin guide, a Case Type value Service Provider, Nightly Jobs
scheduled, and the **Provider Requests** extra permission on your user.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | With Send Cases to a service provider off, create a Case of Type Service Provider. In Anonymous Apex run `System.enqueueJob(new CaseProviderRequests());`. | Nothing on the Provider Requests tab. |
| 2 | Turn the setting on and run the same line. | A Provider Request named by the Case Number, with a Request Number and Provider Status New. The provider org has the request with Channel Partner Organization. |
| 3 | Run it again. | Still one request at the provider; the row's Last Synced moves on. |
| 4 | At the provider, resolve the request with a resolution. Run it again. | Provider Status Resolved and the resolution on the row. |
| 5 | At the provider, untick Active on the connection. Create another Case and run it again. | Its row shows Last Error "The service provider refused the Case (403)..."; the Error Log has a Warning. |
| 6 | Build a record-triggered flow on Case calling **Send Cases to a Service Provider**, reactivate the connection, create a Case. | The row appears within a minute, without waiting for the hourly check. |

**Cleanup:** delete the Cases, the flow and the Provider Requests; turn the setting off.

## T-MIR-17: Mirror Installs With Core Alone

**Purpose:** confirm Mirror needs no nonprofit module (N-09) and its gift features are in Mirror
for Giving.
**Prerequisites:** a fresh scratch org (Person Accounts or `sales-cloud` shape, so Case exists)
with Core only, made with `scripts/org/create-scratch-org.sh`.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Deploy Mirror alone: `sf project deploy start --source-dir packages/mirror --target-org <alias>`. | The deploy succeeds; Giving and Rollup Builder are not in the org. |
| 2 | Open **BarnCRM Settings**, **Modules** with the Standard Edition chosen. | **BarnCRM Mirror** is listed (offered in both editions) and says **Installed**. **BarnCRM Mirror for Giving** is not listed. |
| 3 | Open **Access**, **Extra Permissions**, and give yourself **Provider Requests**. | The card reads "See the Provider Requests tab..."; the **Provider Requests** tab opens with no rows. |
| 4 | Open **General**, **Nightly Jobs**. | No Opportunity mirror or Gift Transaction mirror step is listed (those are Mirror for Giving's). |
| 5 | Choose the Nonprofit Edition and open **Modules** again. | **BarnCRM Mirror for Giving** is listed under **Nonprofit Modules**, **Not installed**, and its row says "Install these first: ..." naming Rollup Builder and Giving. |

**Cleanup:** delete the scratch org.

## T-MIR-18: Hourly Case Check Only While Cases Are Open

**Purpose:** confirm the Case check is one hourly job that does nothing while no request or
Case is open (N-10).
**Prerequisites:** the org and setup of T-MIR-16, its cleanup done (no open Case of Type Service
Provider, no open Provider Request); **Send Cases to a service provider** on.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **General**, **Nightly Jobs**, and click **Run Now** on **Cases Sent to a Service Provider**. | The step's line reads "Checks every hour at a quarter past, only while a request or a Case of the chosen Type is open..." |
| 2 | In Setup, **Scheduled Jobs**. | One job **BarnCRM Mirror: Case requests hourly**, next run at 15 minutes past the hour. |
| 3 | Click **Run Now** again. | Still one such job. |
| 4 | After the next quarter past the hour, open **Setup**, **Apex Jobs**, and the Error Log. | No CaseProviderRequests job ran and no Error Log entry was written for it. |
| 5 | Create a Case of Type Service Provider and wait past the next quarter past the hour. | A Provider Request for the Case, with a Request Number, appears without anyone running anything. |
| 6 | At the provider, resolve the request, and wait past the next quarter past the hour. | Provider Status Resolved on the row. |
| 7 | Switch the step off on the **Nightly Jobs** card and wait past the next quarter past the hour. | The **BarnCRM Mirror: Case requests hourly** job is gone from Scheduled Jobs. |

**Cleanup:** switch the step back on, delete the Case and its Provider Request, and turn the
setting off.
