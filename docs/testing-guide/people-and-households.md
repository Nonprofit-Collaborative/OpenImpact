# People and Households

Scripts for people, households, the Members and Household panels, names and greetings, merge and split, preferred phone, interaction notes and the record pages. Setup detail: [Households](../admin-guide/households.md), [Household members](../admin-guide/household-members.md), [Household names and greetings](../admin-guide/household-naming.md), [Merging and splitting households](../admin-guide/household-merge-split.md), [Preferred phone](../admin-guide/preferred-phone.md), [Interaction notes](../admin-guide/interaction-notes.md), [Record pages](../admin-guide/record-pages.md).

Before you start: an org from [Before you test](before-you-test.md), with Core deployed and sample data loaded unless a script says otherwise. In a [Core-only real-org sandbox](before-you-test.md#core-only-real-org-sandbox) there is no sample data: create the Zztest fixture first and read Garcia as Zztest. T-HH-14 needs a person account, so skip it there. The **Households** and **Preferred Email and Phone** features must be on (BarnCRM Settings, **General**). Open every record from the **BarnCRM** app. Check which way of belonging the org uses (BarnCRM Settings, **People and Households**, **How people belong to a household**): **One household per person (simple)** or **A person can belong to more than one household (flexible)**. Steps that differ between the two say so. The sample people are contacts in both org shapes.

## T-HH-01: A New Person Gets a Household

**Purpose:** saving a person with no household creates and names one, and both panels show it.
**Prerequisites:** admin. **Create households automatically** is on (ships on).
**Smoke:** yes

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open the **Contacts** tab, select **New**, enter Salutation `Ms.`, First Name `Ada`, Last Name `Testwell`, leave the account blank, and save. | The person saves. In the simple way the account field names **The Testwell Family**; in the flexible way it stays blank. |
| 2 | Look at the **Household** panel on Ada's page. | It links to **The Testwell Family**, reads **1 member**, and shows **Formal greeting: Ms. Ada Testwell**. |
| 3 | Select the household name in the panel. | The household page opens. The **Members** panel lists Ada Testwell with a **Primary** badge. **Name and Greetings** shows Formal Greeting **Ms. Ada Testwell**, Informal Greeting **Ada**, Member Count **1**, Primary Contact **Ada Testwell**. |
| 4 | Open **Home**, then select **New Household**. | A household named **New Household** is created and its page opens, with no record type prompt. Delete it. |

**Cleanup:** keep Ada and The Testwell Family for T-HH-02 to T-HH-07.

## T-HH-02: Add Member and Automatic Naming (Simple Way)

**Purpose:** Add Member creates a person in the household and the name and greetings follow the members.
**Prerequisites:** admin, simple way, T-HH-01 done. Use T-HH-03 instead in the flexible way.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On The Testwell Family, select **Add Member** in the **Members** panel. | The **Add Member** dialog opens with **Add Someone Already in Salesforce** (a search box), then **Or Add Someone New** with Salutation, First Name, Last Name, Email and Phone, a **Save** and a **Cancel** button. |
| 1a | Type `Garcia` in the search box and choose Maria Garcia, who is in The Garcia Family. | A line reads "Maria Garcia is in The Garcia Family and will move to this household." with **Save** and **Cancel**. **Cancel** removes the line and moves nobody; this time select **Save**: the dialog closes, Maria is a tile here and The Garcia Family lost her. Move her back with **Move to Another Household**. |
| 2 | Enter `Mr.`, `Ben`, `Testwell` and select **Save**. | The dialog closes. A toast reads **Added. The household name and greetings have been brought up to date.** Ben appears as a tile with his initials **BT**. |
| 3 | Refresh the page. | Member Count **2**. Formal Greeting **Ms. Ada Testwell and Mr. Ben Testwell**. Informal Greeting **Ada and Ben**. The name stays **The Testwell Family**. |
| 4 | Add a third member `Wei` `Lee` (no salutation) and refresh. | Member Count **3**. The name reads **Testwell and Lee Household** because the surnames differ. |
| 5 | Open the menu on Wei's tile and select **Move to Another Household**, pick **The Garcia Family** in the picker and select **Save**. | A toast reads **Moved. Both households have been brought up to date.** Wei leaves the list; the name returns to **The Testwell Family**, Member Count **2**. |
| 6 | Reverse it: open The Garcia Family, use **Move to Another Household** on Wei, and choose The Testwell Family. | Wei is back in The Testwell Family; The Garcia Family is back to its three members and its own name. |

**Cleanup:** delete Wei Lee.

## T-HH-03: Add Member (Flexible Way)

**Purpose:** in the flexible way Add Member offers search and create.
**Prerequisites:** admin, flexible way, T-HH-01 done.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On The Testwell Family, select **Add Member**. | The **Add Member** dialog shows **Add Someone Already in Salesforce** with a search box (placeholder **Search by name**) and **Or Add Someone New** with Salutation, First name and Last name. |
| 2 | Type `zzqq` in the search box. | **No matches. Keep typing, or add them as a new person below.** |
| 3 | Leave Last name empty and select **Save**. | **Enter at least a last name before saving.** Nothing is created. |
| 4 | Enter `Mr.`, `Ben`, `Testwell` and select **Save**. | A toast confirms the add; Ben is listed; after refresh Member Count is **2** and Informal Greeting **Ada and Ben**. |
| 5 | Open **Add Member** again, search `Diego`, and select **Diego Garcia**. | Diego joins The Testwell Family and stays in The Garcia Family. His **Household** panel lists both households. |
| 6 | Open the **Household Members** tab, open Diego's new membership, set **End Date** to yesterday, and save. | Diego disappears from The Testwell Family's panel and its Member Count drops by one. The Garcia Family is unchanged. |
| 7 | Create a second current membership for Ben in The Testwell Family from the **Household Members** tab. | Refused: **This person is already a current member of this household. Edit their existing membership instead of adding another.** |
| 8 | Open **Add Member** on The Testwell Family and, under **Or Add Someone New**, type First Name `Diego` and Last Name `Garcia`. Wait a moment. | A note under the name reads **Already in BarnCRM: Diego Garcia**, his city if known and **(The Garcia Family)**, then **Use this person instead?** Typing `Ben` `Testwell` offers nobody, because Ben is already a member. |
| 9 | Select **Use this person instead?** on Diego. | The dialog closes; Diego is listed as a member, and Contacts still holds one Diego Garcia. Remove this membership afterwards. |

**Cleanup:** delete Diego's ended membership record.

## T-HH-04: Make Primary

**Purpose:** Make Primary moves the primary contact and the Primary Contact field follows.
**Prerequisites:** admin, The Testwell Family with Ada and Ben.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open the menu on Ben's tile and select **Make Primary**. | A toast reads **Ben Testwell is now the primary contact.** The **Primary** badge moves to Ben; **Make Primary** now shows in Ada's menu and not in Ben's. |
| 2 | Refresh. | Primary Contact reads **Ben Testwell**. |
| 3 | Simple way: edit the household and set Primary Contact to **Harper Garcia**. | Refused: **The Primary Contact has to be somebody in this household. Choose one of its members, or move the person into the household first.** |
| 4 | Flexible way: edit the household and change Primary Contact to Ada. | Refused with a message starting **In this org a household's Primary Contact follows the member marked primary.** |
| 5 | Select **Make Primary** on Ada to put it back. | Badge and Primary Contact return to Ada. |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-HH-05: Greetings: Deceased, Preferred Name, Exclusions, Custom Name

**Purpose:** person-level boxes change the greetings, and Custom Name locks the name and every greeting that has a value.
**Prerequisites:** admin, The Testwell Family with Ada and Ben, **Include people who have died in names** off (ships off).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On Ben, set **Preferred Name** to `Benji` and save. Refresh the household. | Informal Greeting **Ada and Benji**. Formal Greeting still **Ms. Ada Testwell and Mr. Ben Testwell**. |
| 2 | On Ben, tick **Exclude From Greetings** and save. Refresh the household. | Informal Greeting **Ada**, Formal Greeting **Ms. Ada Testwell**. Member Count still **2**. |
| 3 | Untick it, tick **Deceased** on Ben, and save. Refresh the household. | Greetings leave Ben out. His row in **Members** carries a **Deceased** badge. |
| 4 | Untick **Deceased**. On the household tick **Custom Name**, set the name to `The Testwell Household (custom)`, and save. | The name saves as typed. |
| 5 | Add a member `Cy` `Testwell` and refresh. | Name and greetings are unchanged; Member Count goes up. |
| 6 | On the household clear **Informal Greeting** and save. On Cy, set **Preferred Name** to `Cyrus` and save. Refresh the household. | Informal Greeting is filled from the members and includes Cyrus. Name and Formal Greeting are unchanged. |
| 7 | Untick **Custom Name** and save. | The name is recalculated at once to **The Testwell Family** and the greetings include Cy. |

**Cleanup:** delete Cy Testwell; clear Ben's Preferred Name.

## T-HH-06: Naming Patterns, Preview and Recompute

**Purpose:** the naming panel previews, saves and recomputes, and is read only without the permission.
**Prerequisites:** admin; read-only user for step 6.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **BarnCRM Settings**, **People and Households**. | In the **Household Names and Greetings** box, the **Household Names and Greetings** panel shows **Household name pattern**, **Formal greeting pattern**, **Informal greeting pattern**, and **How Five Sample Households Would Read**. |
| 2 | Change **Household name pattern** to `{LastName} Household`. | The preview updates as you type. |
| 3 | Select **Save**. | **Saved. New households use these patterns straight away.** |
| 4 | Select **Update All Household Names**, then **Yes, Recompute** in the dialog. | **Updating household names in the background.** After a few minutes The Garcia Family reads **Garcia Household**; the **Staff Household** (Custom Name) keeps its name and every greeting that has a value; only a blank greeting is filled. |
| 5 | Put the pattern back to `The {LastName} Family`, save, and recompute again. | Names return to **The Garcia Family** form. |
| 6 | As read-only, open the same panel. | **You can see these settings but not change them. Changing them needs the Manage BarnCRM Settings permission.** The patterns cannot be saved. |
| 7 | As admin, look at the table under **How Five Sample Households Would Read** at normal desktop width. | The whole table fits inside the settings panel: long names and greetings wrap onto more lines, and there is no horizontal scroll bar on the table or the page. |

**Cleanup:** pattern back to `The {LastName} Family`.

## T-HH-07: Merge Two Households (with Cancel)

**Purpose:** merge combines two households after a warning, and cancel leaves both untouched.
**Prerequisites:** admin (staff also passes), The Testwell Family with Ada and Ben (Ben is added in T-HH-02 steps 1 to 3; the smoke list runs those first). Step 7 needs an organization with Bayview in its name: sample data has **Bayview Hardware**; with no sample data, first create an organization `Zztest Bayview Hardware` (an organization: the record type in **Record type for organizations**).
**Smoke:** yes

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create a contact `Cara` `Testwell` with no account. | A second household named **The Testwell Family** is created for her. |
| 2 | Open the first Testwell household (Ada's) and select **Merge or Split** in the action bar. | A window titled **Merge or Split Households** opens on the **Merge** tab with **Pick a household to see the two side by side.** |
| 3 | Type `Testwell` in **Find the Other Household** and pick Cara's household. | The picker lists households only, never this one, each with its billing city. The comparison shows **Field**, **This Household**, **The Other Household**; differing values offer **Keep This One** or **Keep the Other One**. **Members After the Merge** lists Ada and Ben (**From this household**) and Cara (**From the other household**). |
| 3a | Select **Keep the Other Household Instead**, then **Keep This Household Instead**. | The first swaps the roles: the columns stay put, the members' badges stay with their households, and the link reads **Keep This Household Instead**; the second swaps back. (Merging while swapped keeps Cara's household and the page goes to it.) |
| 4 | Select **Merge**. | A dialog headed **This Cannot Be Undone** says Cara's household will be combined into this one. |
| 5 | Select **Cancel**. | Nothing changes: both households still exist with their members. |
| 6 | Select **Merge**, then **Merge Households**. | Toast **Merged. The household you kept now holds everyone from both.** The window closes and the page refreshes: Member Count **3**, Cara in **Members**. Cara's old household no longer exists. |
| 7 | Type `Bayview` in **Find the Other Household**. | **No households match what you typed.** Organizations are never offered. |

**Cleanup:** keep the merged household for T-HH-08.

## T-HH-08: Split and Reverse a Split

**Purpose:** split moves people to a new household, and a second split to an existing household reverses it.
**Prerequisites:** admin, The Testwell Family with Ada, Ben and Cara.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Select **Merge or Split**, then the **Split** tab. | Under **Choose Who Moves Out**, two columns: **Stays in** the household's name, holding the three members as tiles with checkboxes, and an empty **Moves to a New Household**. **Split** is disabled until someone is in the Moves column. |
| 1a | Drag Ben's tile into **Moves to a New Household** (on a tablet, press and hold first), then use **Move to** with the household's name in his tile's menu. | The drag moves Ben across and ticks his checkbox, and a screen reader hears **Moved Ben Testwell to a New Household.**; the menu moves him back and unticks it. With the keyboard: focus his tile, Space, Right Arrow, Space does the same. |
| 1b | Press Tab through the first tile. | Each tile has three stops: a drag handle (a button named for the person), the checkbox and the **Move to** menu. Only the handle starts a drag, with the mouse, press and hold, or Space and the arrow keys. |
| 2 | Tick Cara, leave **A new household**, and select **Split**. | Cara's tile moves to the Moves column. A dialog headed **Split This Household?** opens. |
| 3 | Select **Split** in the dialog. | Toast **Moved. Both household names and member counts are up to date.** Cara's new household **The Testwell Family** has Member Count **1**; the original has **2**. |
| 4 | Undo: on Cara's new household, **Merge or Split**, **Split**, tick Cara, choose **An existing household**, pick the original in **Find the Other Household**, and split. | The Moves column heading changes to **Moves to** the original's name. Cara is back in the original (Member Count **3**). Her emptied household remains with Member Count **0** and keeps its name, because **Delete Empty Households** ships off. |

**Cleanup:** delete the empty household.

## T-HH-09: Household Settings

**Purpose:** delete-empty and the way-of-belonging guard work from the console.
**Prerequisites:** admin, sample data loaded.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In an org without Person Accounts that has not changed it, open **BarnCRM Settings**, **People and Households**, and read **How people belong to a household** without touching it. | **One household per person (simple)** is selected, never an empty choice. (An org with Person Accounts, or one set up alongside Nonprofit Cloud, shows **A person can belong to more than one household (flexible)** instead.) |
| 2 | Switch **How people belong to a household** to the other way and save. | Refused with a message starting **You cannot switch to the flexible way of belonging yet.** (or **...to the simple way...**) naming how many people it affects. The setting is unchanged. |
| 3 | Tick **Delete empty households** and save. | Saved. |
| 4 | Create contact `Dee` `Testempty`, then move Dee into The Testwell Family with **Move to Another Household**. | Dee's own household is deleted (it is gone from the **Households** tab). |
| 5 | Untick **Delete empty households** and save. | Saved. |

**Cleanup:** delete Dee Testempty.

## T-HH-10: Read-Only User on People and Households

**Purpose:** a read-only user sees households but cannot change BarnCRM membership or settings.
**Prerequisites:** read-only user, with the Salesforce **Read Only** profile as [Before you test](before-you-test.md#test-users) says (a profile that can edit accounts and contacts would show the buttons below).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open the **Households** tab and The Garcia Family. | The **Members** panel and **Name and Greetings** show. |
| 2 | Look at the **Members** panel, in either way of belonging. | The members and their badges show. There is no **Add Member** button and no menu on the member tiles. |
| 3 | Open the **Household Members** tab (from the navigation menu if it is not shown). | It opens and lists membership records (none in the simple way of belonging); no **New** button. |
| 4 | Open **BarnCRM Settings**, **People and Households**. | The settings show and cannot be saved; the naming panel shows the read-only notice from T-HH-06. |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-HH-11: Preferred Phone

**Purpose:** Preferred Phone copies the chosen number into Phone and refuses an empty choice.
**Prerequisites:** admin; **Copy preferred phone on a person** on (Automation page, ships on). Home Phone, Mobile, Other Phone, Work Phone and Preferred Phone are in the person page's **Reaching This Person** section.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On Ada Testwell enter Home Phone `555-0101`, Mobile `555-0102`, leave Preferred Phone empty, and save. | Phone is unchanged. |
| 2 | Set **Preferred Phone** to **Mobile** and save. | Phone reads **555-0102**. |
| 3 | Set **Preferred Phone** to **Work** and **Work Phone** to `555-0103`, and save. | Phone reads **555-0103**. |
| 4 | Set **Preferred Phone** to **Other** with Other Phone empty, and save. | Refused: **The Other phone number is empty, so there is nothing to put in the ordinary Phone box. Type that number in, or choose a different preferred phone.** |
| 5 | Undo: clear Preferred Phone, type `555-0199` in Phone, and save. | Phone keeps **555-0199**. |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-HH-12: Log an Interaction

**Purpose:** Log an interaction saves a completed activity on the person and the household.
**Prerequisites:** staff user.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open Harper Garcia and select **Log an Interaction**. | A window opens with Subject, the date (defaults to today), Type (**Meeting**), Name, Assigned To and Comments. |
| 2 | Enter Subject `Coffee test`, change the date to last Friday, and save. | The note appears under past activity on Harper, dated last Friday, completed. |
| 3 | Clear Subject and try to save a second note. | The window refuses the save until Subject is filled. |
| 4 | Open The Garcia Family and select **Log an Interaction**, choose **Luis Garcia** in Name, and save. | The note shows on the household and on Luis. |

**Cleanup:** delete both notes.

## T-HH-13: Record Pages by Record Type

**Purpose:** the shipped pages show the right sections and actions per record.
**Prerequisites:** admin.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open The Garcia Family. | Tabs **Details**, **Connections**, **Related**, with **Details** open: sections **Details** and **Name and Greetings**. On **Connections**: panels **Members** and **Addresses**. Actions **Edit**, **Log an Interaction**, **Merge or Split**, **Delete**. |
| 2 | Open **Bayview Hardware** from **Organizations**. | **Details** tab with Website; **Connections** tab with the **Affiliations** and **Addresses** panels; no **Name and Greetings**, no **Members**, no **Merge or Split**. |
| 3 | Open Harper Garcia. | **Details** tab: sections **Person**, **Household**, **Reaching This Person**. **Connections** tab: panels **Household**, **Relationships**, **Affiliations**, **Addresses**. **Related** tab: the related lists. No **Merge or Split**. |
| 4 | Narrow the browser to phone width and open Harper Garcia again. | The three tabs still show and switch; the sidebar cards stack below. |
| 5 | In an org with Core and no other module, look at the top of Harper Garcia's sidebar. | No glance card and no empty space: the Record Glance host shows nothing until a module adds a card. |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-HH-14: Person Account Gets a Household

**Purpose:** a person stored as an account gets a household in the flexible way.
**Prerequisites:** admin, Person Accounts org shape, flexible way, **Household of Person** added to the person account page ([Household members](../admin-guide/household-members.md)).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create a person account `Pat` `Testaccount`. | Saved. Its **Household** panel links to **The Testaccount Family**, **1 member**. |
| 2 | Open that household. | **Members** lists Pat Testaccount with **Primary**; Primary Contact names Pat. |
| 3 | In **BarnCRM Settings**, **People and Households**, try to switch to **One household per person (simple)** and save. | Refused with a message starting **You cannot switch to the simple way of belonging yet.** The setting is unchanged. |

**Cleanup:** delete Pat Testaccount and the household.

## T-HH-15: Staff Merge Households Without Delete on Account

**Purpose:** a Team Member who cannot delete accounts can still merge two households they can edit, and cannot merge one they cannot edit.
**Prerequisites:** admin; a second user `Merge Tester` on the **Minimum Access - Salesforce** profile (the Standard User profile gives Delete on Account, which would hide the problem), given the **Team Member** role on **BarnCRM Settings**, **Access**. Two households `The Mergetest Family`, each created by admin by adding one contact (Maria Mergetest and Wei Mergetest, each in their own household) and then given to Merge Tester with **Change Owner**, and a third household `The Otherowner Family` owned by admin that Merge Tester can read but not edit (only in an org whose account sharing is Private or Public Read Only).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Log in as Merge Tester. Open the first Mergetest household and select **Merge or Split**. | The **Merge** tab opens. There is no notice that changes are switched off. |
| 2 | Pick the second Mergetest household, select **Merge**, then **Merge Households**. | Toast **Merged. The household you kept now holds everyone from both.** The other household no longer exists, and both Maria and Wei are members of the kept one. |
| 3 | On the kept household, select **Merge or Split** and pick The Otherowner Family, then **Merge**, **Merge Households**. | Refused with **You need edit access to both households to merge them.** Both households are unchanged. |

**Cleanup:** as admin, delete the Mergetest household and The Otherowner Family.

## T-HH-16: A Person in a Household Is Not Pointed at an Organization

**Purpose:** in the simple way of belonging, changing a household member's Account Name to an organization is refused, while a person already at an organization can still be moved between organizations.
**Prerequisites:** admin, the simple way of belonging. Two organizations (of the record type chosen in **Record type for organizations**) `Zztest Library` and `Zztest Trust`.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create a contact `Hana` `Hhsixteen` with **Account Name** blank. | Saved, in **The Hhsixteen Family**. |
| 2 | Edit Hana, set **Account Name** to Zztest Library, and save. | Refused with **This person is in a household, so Account Name must stay a household. To connect them to an organization, add an affiliation. To move them, use Move to another household.** Hana is still in The Hhsixteen Family. |
| 3 | Create a contact `Omar` `Hhsixteen` with **Account Name** Zztest Library. | Saved at Zztest Library, with no household. |
| 4 | Edit Omar, set **Account Name** to Zztest Trust, and save. | Saved: Omar was not in a household. |

**Cleanup:** delete Hana, Omar, The Hhsixteen Family and both organizations.

## T-HH-17: A Blocking Account Duplicate Rule Does Not Stop a New Person

**Purpose:** households BarnCRM creates are saved past the org's Account duplicate rules, so adding a person never fails over a look-alike household.
**Prerequisites:** admin; in Setup, an active Account duplicate rule on the standard account matching rule with **Action On Create** set to **Block**. Contact `Ana Duptest` already saved, with her household **The Duptest Family**.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create a contact `Luis` `Duptest`, leaving the account empty. | Saved. Luis has a household of his own, also named **The Duptest Family**. |
| 2 | In Setup, try to create an account named **The Duptest Family** by hand. | Your duplicate rule blocks it, as before. |

**Cleanup:** delete both contacts and their households, then deactivate the duplicate rule.

## T-HH-18: Households Tab Only While Households Is On, Household Record Type Never Offered

**Purpose:** no install adds a record type anyone can pick; turning Households on shows the Households tab to BarnCRM role holders, and households are still made only by BarnCRM.
**Prerequisites:** a fresh scratch org of the Platform-only shape (no Account record types) with Core deployed and first-run setup not finished; a staff user with the Staff role.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As the staff user, open the **BarnCRM** app. | No **Households** tab. |
| 2 | As the staff user, open Accounts and click **New**. | No record type choice; the new account form opens straight away. |
| 3 | As admin, in Setup, open Object Manager, Account, Record Types. | **Household** is listed and active. No **Organization** record type. |
| 4 | As admin, finish first-run setup with **Households** ticked (or choose **Turn On** in its row on **General**). | The confirmation says Households adds the Households tab and that households are created with **New Household** on BarnCRM Home, not the standard **New** button. |
| 5 | Wait a few minutes. As the staff user, reload the **BarnCRM** app. | The **Households** tab is there. |
| 6 | As the staff user, open Accounts and click **New**. | Still no record type choice and no **Household**; the account saves with no record type and appears on **Organizations**, not **Households**. |
| 7 | As the staff user, click **New Household** on BarnCRM Home, save, then edit the household's phone and save. | The household is created and appears on the **Households** tab; the edit saves. |
| 8 | As the staff user, edit the account from step 6 and try to change its record type. | **Household** is not offered (Change Record Type shows no choice, or is not offered). |
| 9 | As the staff user, open the household from step 7. On **Members** select **Add Member**, add `Zztest` `Rt`, then open the household's **Addresses** card. | Before the add the panel shows **No Members Yet**; the **Add Member** dialog opens and the new person shows as a tile. **Addresses** shows **No Addresses Yet** with **Add Address**. Nothing asks for a record type. |
| 10 | As admin, in Setup, open the staff user's permission set assignments, then the **BarnCRM Auto: Households Tab** permission set's record type settings. | **BarnCRM Auto: Households Tab** is assigned; it grants no record type. |
| 11 | In an org that already ran BarnCRM before this change, deploy it, then as admin open **BarnCRM Staff** and its record type settings. | **Household** is no longer listed; staff can still open and edit existing households. |

**Cleanup:** none (Households cannot be turned off).

## T-HH-19: Record Type for Organizations Is Detected and Can Be Changed

**Purpose:** BarnCRM picks the org's own record type for organizations, and offers its own BarnCRM Organization only where the org has none (D-184).
**Prerequisites:** admin. Run once in a Person Accounts org (it has **Business Account**) and once in a Platform-only org.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **BarnCRM Settings**, **General**. | **Record type for organizations** shows **Business Account** in the Person Accounts org and **No record type** in the Platform-only org; never blank. |
| 2 | Open the dropdown. | In the Person Accounts org it lists the org's active Account record types and no **No record type** or **BarnCRM Organization**; in the Platform-only org it lists **No record type** and **BarnCRM Organization**. Never **Household** or a person account record type. In Setup, Object Manager, Account, Record Types, **BarnCRM Organization** is active, and no profile has it. |
| 3 | Open the **Organizations** tab. | Accounts of the chosen record type are listed; households and person accounts are not. |
| 4 | Open one of those organizations. | The **Affiliations** panel and the website show; no **Name and Greetings**, no **Members**, no **Erase Person**. |
| 5 | Import a file with one person and the organization `Zztest Rt Org`. | `Zztest Rt Org` is created with the chosen record type (or none, for **No record type**) and appears on the **Organizations** tab. |
| 6 | In an org with a second business record type, choose it in the setting and save. | Saved, and listed in **Recent Changes**. The **Organizations** tab now lists accounts of that record type instead. Open one: **Is Organization** is checked, and the **Affiliations** panel and website show, with Giving and Volunteers the organization sections too; an account of the first record type now shows **Is Organization** unchecked. |
| 7 | With that record type still chosen, import a file with one person and the organization `Zztest Rt Org 2`, give an organization an address in its billing fields, and load sample data in a sandbox without it. | `Zztest Rt Org 2` is created with that record type; the organization with the billing address gets a first address of type **Work**; sample data's organizations get that record type and the sample data count lists them. |
| 8 | As a user whose profile and permission sets do not give that record type, import a file with two people: one at `Zztest Rt Org 2` (now in Salesforce) and one at the new organization `Zztest Rt Org 3`. | The first row loads, linked to `Zztest Rt Org 2`. The second is rejected with **This row's organization is not in Salesforce yet, and you cannot use the ... record type**, naming it by its label; the run log says no new organization was created for the same reason. `Zztest Rt Org 3` is not created. |
| 9 | In the Platform-only org, choose **BarnCRM Organization** and save. Give it to your profile in Setup (Record Type Settings), then import a file with one person and the organization `Zztest Rt Org 4`. | Saved. `Zztest Rt Org 4` is created as **BarnCRM Organization** and is on the **Organizations** tab. Run **Health Check**: no **You Cannot Use the Record Type for Organizations**. |

**Cleanup:** set the setting back to its first value (and take **BarnCRM Organization** off your profile); delete `Zztest Rt Org`, `Zztest Rt Org 4` and the imported people.

## T-HH-20: An Org Already Running BarnCRM Keeps Its Organizations

**Purpose:** after BarnCRM stops shipping its Organization record type, an org that ran an earlier version keeps its organizations once **Record type for organizations** is set.
**Prerequisites:** admin; an org deployed before this change, with organizations and households (for example a test org with sample data).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Before the deploy, open the **Organizations** tab and note how many records it lists. | A count to compare. |
| 2 | Deploy this version. Open **BarnCRM Settings**, **General**. | **Record type for organizations** shows a record type, never blank. **No record type** is offered only when the org has no Account record type besides Household and person account ones. |
| 3 | Set **Record type for organizations** to the record type your organizations use and save. | Saved, and listed in **Recent Changes**. |
| 4 | Open the **Organizations** tab and the **Households** tab. | The Organizations tab lists the same records as in step 1; the Households tab lists the same records as before. |
| 5 | As a staff user, open a household and an organization. | The same sections and panels as before (T-HH-13): the organization shows **Is Organization** checked, with the **Affiliations** panel. |
| 6 | If step 3 kept **Organization**: before giving it to your profile, run **Health Check**, then load sample data. Then give **Organization** to your profile (Setup, Profiles, Record Type Settings) and run Health Check again. | Before: Health Check warns **You Cannot Use the Record Type for Organizations**, naming Organization, and **Load Sample Data** refuses with a message naming it. After: no such warning. |
| 7 | If step 3 chose another record type: move any accounts still on **Organization** to it, then in Setup, Object Manager, Account, Record Types, deactivate **Organization**. Reopen **BarnCRM Settings**, **General**. | **Record type for organizations** still shows your choice, and Organization is no longer among its choices. The Organizations tab lists the same records as in step 1. |

**Cleanup:** none.

## T-HH-21: Adopt NPSP Households

**Purpose:** NPSP's household accounts become BarnCRM households in place, keep their wording, and can be put back ([Adopting Your NPSP Households](../admin-guide/npsp-households.md)).
**Prerequisites:** admin; **an org with NPSP installed** and at least two NPSP households (one couple with greetings typed by hand, one single person); NPSP's **Automatic Household Naming** off; BarnCRM **Household membership** set to **Contact**. Steps 1 and 9 also run in an org without NPSP. Only an NPSP org proves steps 2 to 8: BarnCRM's own tests use a stand-in for NPSP's fields.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In an org without NPSP, open **BarnCRM Settings**, **General**. | No **Adopt NPSP Households** section, and no mention of NPSP. |
| 2 | In the NPSP org, open **BarnCRM Settings**, **General**. | **Adopt NPSP Households** shows below Coexistence mode, with **N NPSP households can be adopted** (N is your number of NPSP households) and up to ten rows: name, NPSP formal and informal greetings, primary contact, number of contacts. |
| 3 | Set **Household membership** to membership records, save, and return. | The section says to set Household membership to Contact first, and **Adopt Households** is disabled. Set it back to **Contact**. |
| 4 | Leave **Keep NPSP's names and greetings** ticked, select **Adopt Households**, type a number other than N and confirm. | The confirm button stays disabled until the typed number is N. |
| 5 | Type N and select **Adopt**. | The section says the adoption is running, then **Last adoption: N adopted**. The Error Log has one Info entry with the counts. |
| 6 | Open the couple's household. | Same record and Opportunities as before; the BarnCRM household page with **Name and Greetings** and **Members**; record type **Household**; name and greetings exactly as NPSP had them; **Custom Name** ticked; Primary Contact is NPSP's primary contact; Member Count **2**. |
| 7 | Edit one member's first name and save. Refresh the household. | BarnCRM does not rename it (Custom Name). NPSP does not rename it either; if NPSP does, record it as a defect with the NPSP version. |
| 8 | Select **Undo This Adoption**, type N and select **Undo**. | **Last adoption** shows N undone. The couple's household has its NPSP record type again, Custom Name unticked, BarnCRM greetings and Primary Contact blank as before. |
| 9 | As a user without **Manage BarnCRM Settings**, open **BarnCRM Settings**, **General**. | No **Adopt NPSP Households** section. |
| 10 | After step 8, query `SELECT Kind__c, Status__c, Account_Id__c FROM Merge_Journal__c WHERE Kind__c = 'Household Adoption'` (N-11: adoption records are Admin Journal rows). | N rows, each Status **Undone** (or **Not Restored** with the reason in Notes). In an org that also has an auto-merge run, **Last adoption** still counts only adoption rows. |

**Cleanup:** none after step 8.

## T-HH-22: Households Waits While NPSP Households Are in Use

**Purpose:** BarnCRM and NPSP never both make a household for the same person ([Then Turn On Households](../admin-guide/npsp-households.md#then-turn-on-households)).
**Prerequisites:** admin; Households off. Step 1 runs in an org without NPSP; steps 2 to 5 need **an org with NPSP installed** whose Account Model is **Household Account**, with at least one NPSP household. BarnCRM's own tests use a stand-in for NPSP.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In an org without NPSP, open **BarnCRM Settings**, **General**, **Features**. | The **Households** row has **Turn On** and no NPSP explanation. |
| 2 | In the NPSP org, open the same row. | The row says NPSP households are still in use, with the steps, and offers no **Turn On**. In first-run setup the **Households** box is unticked and cannot be ticked, and finishing turns the other ticked features on. |
| 3 | Adopt every NPSP household (T-HH-21 steps 4 and 5) and return. | The row still shows the explanation: NPSP's Account Model is still Household Account. |
| 4 | In NPSP Settings, set **Account Model** to **One-to-One** and save. Return to **Features**. | The explanation is gone and **Turn On** is offered. |
| 5 | Choose **Turn On** and confirm. | Households is on. Add a contact: it gets one BarnCRM household, and NPSP makes no household account for it. |

**Cleanup:** none (Households cannot be turned off).

## T-HH-23: Engagement Score

**Purpose:** Confirm the engagement score is off until turned on, scores people nightly from the weights and targets, leaves out parts whose module is missing, and shows the meter ([Engagement Score](../admin-guide/engagement-score.md)).
**Prerequisites:** admin; the nightly run scheduled; a person Ana with a task logged today. For step 4: Giving installed and a Received gift of 500 from Ana dated this month. A staff user (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)).
**Smoke:** no

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open Ana. In **BarnCRM Settings**, **People and Households**, **People**, look at the three engagement settings. | No **Engagement Score** meter on Ana. **Turn on engagement score** is off; the weights read `Gifts 40, Hours 25, Events 20, Activity 15` and the targets `Gifts 1000, Hours 40, Events 4, Activity 90, Months 12`. On **General**, the **Nightly Jobs** panel lists **Engagement Score** at 2:30 as Off. |
| 2 | Turn on **Turn on engagement score** and save. | The **Nightly Jobs** panel shows **Engagement Score** On. Open Ana: the Engagement Score card says **Not scored yet** (no meter). |
| 3 | In an org with no Giving, Volunteers or Event Management, wait for the nightly run (or run the step from the Developer Console: `Database.executeBatch(new EngagementScoreJob(), 200);`). Open Ana. | Ana's meter reads 100 (only Activity can be measured, and her activity is today) with today's date under **Scored On**. A person with no activity reads 0. |
| 4 | With Giving installed, rescore. Open Ana. | Ana reads 64: Gifts 0.5 x 40 plus Activity 1 x 15, over 40 + 15. |
| 5 | Set the weights to `Gifts 0, Activity 10` and rescore. | Ana reads 100: Gifts weighs nothing, so the score is Activity alone. |
| 6 | Log in as the staff user and open Ana. Try to edit **Engagement Score**. | The meter shows the same score; the field cannot be edited. |
| 7 | As admin, turn the setting off and save. Open Ana. | No meter. The panel shows the step Off; tonight's run records it Skipped. |

**Cleanup:** put the weights back to the default line; leave the setting off.

## T-HH-24: Date Rules Use the Organization's Date

**Purpose:** Confirm membership and address date rules read today in the organization's time zone, not the tester's (D-208, [Household Members](../admin-guide/household-members.md#what-it-does)).
**Prerequisites:** admin in a test org nobody else is using; a household with two members, each with a membership record (flexible way of belonging); note the org's **Default Time Zone** (Setup, **Company Information**) and your own time zone (**Settings**, **Personal Information**) to put back afterwards.
**Smoke:** no

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Set the org's **Default Time Zone** to `(GMT+14:00) Line Islands Time (Pacific/Kiritimati)` and your own time zone to `(GMT-10:00) Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time (Pacific/Honolulu)`. | Saved. The org's date is now always one day after your own. |
| 2 | Open one member's membership record and set **End Date** to the org's date (your own tomorrow). Save, then open the household. | The person no longer shows as a current member: the membership ended today, org-wide. |
| 3 | On the household's **Addresses** card add a new address with **Primary** ticked, a different place from the current one. | The old address reads **Former** with **End Date** the org's date, and the new one has **Start Date** the org's date (your own tomorrow), not your own date. |

**Cleanup:** put the org's Default Time Zone and your own time zone back; end-date or delete the test membership and address as you left them.
