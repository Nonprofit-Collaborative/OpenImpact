# Org Optimizer and Health Check

Scripts for the Org Optimizer page (its sections, Storage and Limits, Unused Setup) and Health Check (findings, fix buttons, read-only view, the Home tile). Setup detail: [Org Optimizer](../admin-guide/org-optimizer.md), [Health Check](../admin-guide/health-check.md).

Before you start: an org from [Before you test](before-you-test.md), with Core deployed and sample data loaded unless a script says otherwise. In a [Core-only real-org sandbox](before-you-test.md#core-only-real-org-sandbox) there is no sample data, and the read-only reports (Health Check, storage, limits, Field Use) read the real org. Do not select a fix button that changes an org-wide setting. In **BarnCRM Settings**, **General**, the **Org Optimizer and Health Check** feature is **On**. Data Quality, Duplicates and Field Use have their own scripts in [Data Manager and job history](data-manager-and-job-history.md) and [Duplicates](duplicates.md).

## T-HC-01: Org Optimizer Sections for an Admin

**Purpose:** Confirm an admin sees every section and nothing runs until a section is opened.
**Prerequisites:** admin (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)).
**Smoke:** yes

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In the BarnCRM app, open the **Org Optimizer** tab. | The page name **Org Optimizer** once (no second title card), then **What in your org needs attention, one section at a time.** On your first visit **About This Tool** is open with a **Learn More** link that opens the admin guide in a new tab. **Overview** is selected. |
| 2 | Read **Overview**. | Tiles with an icon and one line each, under **Check Your Data** (**Data Quality**, **Field Use**, **Data Dictionary**, **AI-Readiness Export**) and **Check Your Setup** (**Health Check**, **Errors**, **Storage and Limits**, **Unused Setup**, **Setup Changes**, **Access Explorer**). **Errors** has a badge (**{n} New** or **All Clear**); **Health Check** has **Not Run Yet** on a new org, otherwise the last run's result. No **Duplicates** (they are on the **Duplicate Matching** tab). |
| 3 | Look at the section list on the left. | The same look as **BarnCRM Settings**: each section with its icon (the Overview tile's icon), **Overview** first, then **Check Your Data** (**Data Quality**, **Field Use**, **Data Dictionary**, **AI-Readiness Export**) and **Check Your Setup** (**Health Check**, **Errors**, **Storage and Limits**, **Unused Setup**, **Setup Changes**, **Access Explorer**). Each section has one heading and no card inside the page's card. |
| 3a | Choose **Storage and Limits** in the list with the keyboard (Tab to the list, arrow keys, Enter). | The section opens and the focus moves to it; a screen reader reads **Storage and Limits**. |
| 3b | Narrow the window below tablet width (or open the page on a phone). | The list is replaced by a **Show** box at the top. Choose **Unused Setup** in it: the section opens below and the focus moves to it. Widen the window again: the list is back with **Unused Setup** selected. |
| 4 | Select the **Errors** tile. | The **Errors** section opens with the **Error Log** card: a count of new entries (or **Nothing has gone wrong. There is nothing to read here.**) and **Open the Error Log**. |
| 5 | Choose **Health Check**. | Where the tile said **Not Run Yet**: an illustration, **Health Check Runs When You Ask**, **Health Check reads your org's setup, which can take a few seconds, so it runs only when you ask.** and **Run Health Check**. Where the tile showed a result: the same badge, **Last run** with a date and time, **{n} to fix, {n} to be aware of, {n} for your information.** matching the tile, and **Run Again**. Either way no check runs and no findings show yet. |
| 6 | Click **Run Health Check** (or **Run Again**). | **Reading your org**, then the Health Check report with **What We Found in Your Org** and grouped findings. The button now reads **Run Again**. |
| 7 | Choose **Overview**, then **Health Check** again. | On **Overview** the **Health Check** tile shows the run's result in the report's own words (**Needs Fixing: {n}**, **Worth Knowing: {n}** or **All Clear**). Back on **Health Check**, the same report shows without running again. |
| 7a | Run Health Check from BarnCRM Home's Health Check tile, then reload **Org Optimizer**. | The **Health Check** tile shows that run's result, and the **Health Check** section shows the same run under **Last run**, never **Health Check Runs When You Ask** beside a tile with a result (owner QA, 2026-10-31). |
| 7b | Open `/lightning/n/Data_Hygiene?c__section=healthCheck`, then `/lightning/n/Data_Hygiene?c__section=errors`. | The page opens straight at **Health Check** (the stored run, nothing runs), then at **Errors**. `c__section=nothing` opens on **Overview**. |
| 8 | Choose **Data Quality**, then **Storage and Limits**, then **Overview**. | **Data Quality** has **{n} Need Attention** or **All Clear**; **Storage and Limits** has **Data Storage {n}%**. Reload the page: **About This Tool** is now closed. |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-HC-02: Who Sees Org Optimizer

**Purpose:** Confirm the tab and sections follow each person's permissions.
**Prerequisites:** staff; admin to give and take permissions.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As staff, open the BarnCRM app. | No **Org Optimizer** tab. |
| 2 | As admin, give the staff user **BarnCRM Find and Export** in **BarnCRM Settings**, **Access**, **Extra Permissions**. | A message says the staff user now has it. |
| 3 | As staff, wait a minute, reload, and open **Org Optimizer**. | Only **Overview** and **Data Quality**. **Overview** has one tile, **Data Quality**, under **Check Your Data**. |
| 4 | Choose **Data Quality**. | The checks count with the staff user's own access. |

**Cleanup:** Remove **BarnCRM Find and Export** from the staff user.

## T-HC-03: Health Check Report and Run Again

**Purpose:** Confirm the full report reads the org, groups findings and re-runs.
**Prerequisites:** admin. Setup Assistant steps you skipped (for example the module and access steps) add findings beyond the ones named here: read them, they are expected, and they do not fail this script.
**Smoke:** yes

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **Org Optimizer**, choose **Health Check** and click **Run Health Check** (or **Run Again**). | **Health Check**, **What BarnCRM found in your org, and what to do about it.** The part **What We Found in Your Org** shows what was detected (for example **Person Accounts enabled**), **Coexistence mode** and **Recommended**. |
| 2 | Read the findings. | Grouped under **Your Org**, **Licenses**, **Access** and **Settings**. Each has a severity icon read as **Needs Fixing**, **Worth Knowing** or **Information**, a title in Title Case, a sentence on what to do and, for most, a button. |
| 3 | Find **Your Org at a Glance**. | An **Information** finding that ends by saying Shield Platform Encryption cannot be detected from inside the app. |
| 4 | Find the automation finding. | **Automation Is Running Normally**, **Information**. |
| 5 | Look for a fiscal year finding. | With a standard fiscal year in Setup (the default), there is none. An org that uses a custom fiscal year shows **Your Org Uses a Custom Fiscal Year**, **Information**, naming the start month, with no button. |
| 6 | Click **Run Again**. | **Reading your org**, then the report again. |
| 7 | If **Use Recommended Mode** shows, click it. | The confirm box reads **Coexistence mode (how BarnCRM shares people and households with NPSP or Nonprofit Cloud) changes from ... to ....** Click **Cancel**: nothing changes. |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-HC-04: A Fix Button Asks First

**Purpose:** Confirm a fix shows what it will do, Cancel changes nothing, and Confirm does exactly that and is recorded.
**Prerequisites:** admin. A fresh org: no BarnCRM nightly job scheduled yet.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On **Org Optimizer**, **Health Check**, click **Run Health Check** (or **Run Again**) and find **Nightly Jobs Are Not Scheduled**. | It names the jobs, for example **Error Digest Email**, **Empty Household Tidy-Up**, and has **Schedule All Nightly Jobs**. |
| 2 | Click **Schedule All Nightly Jobs**. | A dialog **Before This Fix Runs**: **This is what the fix will do. Nothing changes until you confirm.**, the same list, **Confirm** and **Cancel**. |
| 3 | Press Escape. | The dialog closes and focus returns to the button. Nothing is scheduled. |
| 4 | Click **Schedule All Nightly Jobs**, then **Confirm**. | **Done. Scheduled: ...** naming each job, and the report re-runs. **Nightly Jobs Are Not Scheduled** is gone. |
| 5 | In **BarnCRM Settings**, open **General** and scroll to **Recent Changes**. | The top entry starts **Health Check:** with the button's name, your name and the time. |
| 6 | Open **BarnCRM Settings**, **Error Log**. | The **Error Digest** panel shows as scheduled, so the job can be stopped on its own page. The seasonal address swap is not on the list unless **Turn on seasonal addresses** is ticked on the **Addresses** page, and then it is scheduled already. |

**Cleanup:** None. Leave the jobs scheduled.

## T-HC-05: An Empty Household Finding Links the Record

**Purpose:** Confirm a data finding counts and links an empty household and changes nothing.
**Prerequisites:** admin. A Household account with no members, for example `Empty Test Household` from T-DM-10.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On **Org Optimizer**, **Health Check**, click **Run Again**. | **1 Household Has Nobody in It** (or **N Households Have Nobody in Them**), **Information**, with **The first is linked below.** or **The first N are linked below.** |
| 2 | Look for a fix button on it. | None: what to do with an empty household is your decision. |
| 3 | Click the `Empty Test Household` link. | The household opens, unchanged. |
| 4 | Delete `Empty Test Household`, return and **Run Again**. | The count drops by one (the finding is gone if it was the only one). |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-HC-06: Health Check as the Read-Only User

**Purpose:** Confirm someone without Manage BarnCRM Settings can read the report but not fix anything, and access checks are skipped.
**Prerequisites:** read-only; admin to make a finding with a button (stop one nightly job on its page, for example the error digest on **BarnCRM Settings**, **Error Log**).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As read-only, open **BarnCRM Settings** and choose **Health**. | The report shows with **You can read this report but not change anything. Ask your BarnCRM admin for the Manage BarnCRM Settings permission.** |
| 2 | Look under **Access**. | **Only a BarnCRM Admin Can See the Access Checks**, instead of the admin and user counts. |
| 3 | Find **Nightly Jobs Are Not Scheduled**. | It is not shown (only administrators see it), and no finding has a fix button. |
| 4 | Check the app's navigation. | No **Org Optimizer** tab. |

**Cleanup:** As admin, run **Schedule All Nightly Jobs** again.

## T-HC-07: Health Check's Last Result on Home

**Purpose:** Confirm Home shows the last full run instead of running each time, and Run Health Check (Run Again after the first run) refreshes it.
**Prerequisites:** admin.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open the BarnCRM home page. | The Health Check tile shows **Last Run** with a date and time and **N to fix, N to be aware of, N for your information.**, and **Run Again**, or **Health Check has not run yet. Click Run Health Check to check this org.** and **Run Health Check**. |
| 2 | Click **Run Health Check** (or **Run Again**). | **Reading your org**, then the whole report in the tile. |
| 3 | Reload the home page. | **Last Run** shows the time of step 2, with its counts. |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-HC-08: Storage and Limits

**Purpose:** Confirm the read-only storage section shows the org's limits and BarnCRM's own records.
**Prerequisites:** admin.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **Org Optimizer**, choose **Storage and Limits**. | **Your Org's Limits** lists **Data Storage (MB)**, **File Storage (MB)**, **API Requests in the Last 24 Hours**, **Background Jobs (Asynchronous Apex) in the Last 24 Hours**, **Single Emails Sent Today**, each with a bar and **N of N (N%)** beside it, and an amber **Near Limit** badge with a warning icon under any at 80% or more. |
| 2 | Read **What BarnCRM Stores**. | **Records BarnCRM keeps for imports, undo and errors. Salesforce counts most records as 2 KB.** and a table with **Kind of Record**, **Records** and **About (MB)**. |
| 3 | Look for anything that changes data. | Only **Refresh**. Click it: the numbers reload. |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-HC-09: Unused Setup and Its Thresholds

**Purpose:** Confirm the read-only checks list counts and Setup links, and the thresholds are bounded settings.
**Prerequisites:** admin.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **Org Optimizer**, choose **Unused Setup**. | **Nothing here is changed for you. Open each item in Setup and decide whether to remove it.** Then seven checks, and a closed part titled **For Developers: Old Code and Flows** with five more (see T-HC-10), including **Active Users Who Have Not Logged In for 90 Days**, **Permission Sets Nobody Is Assigned**, **Reports Not Run for 365 Days**, **Email Templates Never Used**, **Scheduled Jobs Owned by Inactive Users**, **Objects Near Their Custom Field Limit**, **Record Types No Record Uses, or Inactive**. |
| 2 | Read a check with a count above 0. | The count in a warning-colored badge, up to five names, and **Open in Setup** with a new-window icon. A check the org does not allow reads **Could not check: your access or this org does not allow it.** |
| 3 | Click **Open in Setup** on one check. | The matching Setup page opens. Nothing was removed. |
| 4 | In **BarnCRM Settings**, **Org Optimizer**, set **Days before a user is unused** to `10` and click **Save**. | Nothing is saved; the value is marked as outside its range (30 to 365). |
| 5 | Set it to `60`, **Save**, then **Refresh** on **Unused Setup**. | **Your settings are saved.** The first check reads **Active Users Who Have Not Logged In for 60 Days**. |

**Cleanup:** Set **Days before a user is unused** back to `90`.

## T-HC-10: Technical Debt Checks Follow the Old API Version Setting

**Purpose:** Confirm the technical debt checks (For Developers: Old Code and Flows) list Apex and flows on old API versions, state what they do not cover, and follow a bounded setting.
**Prerequisites:** admin.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **Org Optimizer**, choose **Unused Setup**. | Below the Unused Setup checks, a closed part titled **For Developers: Old Code and Flows** with an arrow; its checks are hidden. |
| 1a | Select the title (or Tab to it and press Enter). | It opens (a screen reader reads it as expanded), with a line reading "Covers Apex classes, Apex triggers and flows... Not covered: validation rules, workflow rules, process builders...". Select it again: it closes. Open it for the next steps. |
| 2 | Read the checks under **For Developers: Old Code and Flows**. | **Active Apex Classes Below API Version 50**, **Active Apex Triggers Below API Version 50**, **Flows Below API Version 50**, **Active Flows With No Description** and **Inactive Flows**, each with a count and **Open in Setup**. |
| 3 | In **BarnCRM Settings**, **Org Optimizer**, set **Old API version** to `10` and click **Save**. | Nothing is saved; the value is marked as outside its range (21 to 80). |
| 4 | Set it to `80`, **Save**, then **Refresh**. | The three version checks read **Below API Version 80**; **Active Apex Classes** shows a count above 0 with up to five names. |
| 5 | Click **Open in Setup** on **Active Apex Classes**. | The Apex Classes page opens. Nothing was changed. |

**Cleanup:** Set **Old API version** back to `50`.

## T-HC-11: Data Dictionary Lists Fields, Fill Rates and a CSV

**Purpose:** Confirm an admin can document fields, add fill rates and download the table, and that nobody else sees it.
**Prerequisites:** admin and staff (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)); sample data loaded.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As the admin, open **Org Optimizer** and choose **Data Dictionary**. | **Data Dictionary**, a **Kinds of Record** picker with **Account**, **Contact** and Core's data objects (such as **Address** and **Relationship**) already under **Selected**, **Include Fill Rates** unticked, **Build Dictionary** enabled and **Download CSV** disabled. **Choose kinds of record and press Build Dictionary.** shows. |
| 2 | Move everything except **Account** out of **Selected**, then click **Build Dictionary**. | A progress bar, then **Described 1 of 1 kinds of record.** and a table of Account's fields sorted by **Field**, with **Kind of Record**, **API Name**, **Type**, **Length**, **Precision**, **Required**, **Unique**, **External ID**, **Custom**, **Picklist Values**, **Help Text**, **Formula** and **Related To**. No **Fill Rate** column. |
| 3 | Find **Name**, **Website** and **Is Organization**. | **Name** is **Required**: Yes. **Website** has type url and **Custom**: No. **Is Organization** has **Custom**: Yes and its formula in **Formula**. **Parent Account** has **Related To**: Account. |
| 4 | Tick **Include Fill Rates** and click **Build Dictionary**. | The progress line reads **Counting fill rates for Account.** while it counts, then a **Fill Rate** column appears. **Phone** shows a percentage; **Is Organization** (a formula) and checkboxes are blank. |
| 5 | Click **Download CSV**. | A file named **Data_Dictionary-** and today's date ending .csv downloads, and **Downloaded {n} fields.** shows. Open it in a spreadsheet: a header row starting **Object**, **Object API Name**, **Field**, then one row per field with the same values, and **Fill Rate** as a percentage such as 33.3%. |
| 6 | In Setup, give a field help text containing a comma and a quotation mark, such as `Used for "Gifts", mostly`. Build again. | The help text shows whole in the table, and in the CSV it sits in one cell. |
| 7 | Choose all objects, tick **Include Fill Rates** and build, with an object of more than 1,000,000 records if the org has one. | Each object is described. An object over the limit has blank fill rates and **Fill rates not counted for: {object}.** appears under the table. |
| 8 | As staff (no Manage BarnCRM Settings), open **Org Optimizer**. | There is no **Data Dictionary** tile or tab. |

**Cleanup:** Remove the help text added in step 6.

## T-HC-12: Data Dictionary Automation Inventory Lists Triggers and Flows

**Purpose:** Confirm the Data Dictionary lists the Apex triggers and record-triggered flows of each chosen kind of record on request, says what it does not cover, and downloads its own CSV.
**Prerequisites:** admin; Core deployed (it ships an Account trigger and template flows for Affiliation and Account).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **Org Optimizer**, choose **Data Dictionary**, and read under **Include Fill Rates**. | A second checkbox, **Include Flows and Apex Triggers**, off, with a line saying validation rules are not covered. |
| 2 | Move everything except **Account** and **Affiliation** out of **Selected**, leave the new box off, and click **Build Dictionary**. | The field table only. No **Automation Inventory**. |
| 3 | Tick **Include Flows and Apex Triggers** and click **Build Dictionary**. | After the field table, **Automation Inventory** with a note beginning "Covers Apex triggers and record-triggered flows". Rows include **Apex Trigger** **AccountTrigger** (Status **Active**, **Runs** `before insert, ...`), **Apex Trigger** **AffiliationTrigger**, and **Flow** rows for the Affiliation templates (Status **Inactive**, **Runs** **After save**, **Before save** or **Before delete**). |
| 4 | Read the note under **Automation Inventory**. | It says validation rules, workflow rules and process builder criteria are not covered. |
| 5 | Click **Download Automation CSV**. | A file named **Automation_Inventory-** and today's date ending .csv downloads, and **Downloaded {n} automation rows.** shows. The header starts **Object**, **Object API Name**, **Type**. |
| 6 | Click **Download CSV** at the top. | The usual dictionary file, with no automation rows in it. |
| 7 | Choose a kind of record nothing runs on (a custom object with no trigger or flow) and build with the box ticked. | **No Apex triggers or record-triggered flows run on these kinds of record.** |
| 8 | As staff (no Manage BarnCRM Settings), open **Org Optimizer**. | There is no **Data Dictionary** tile or tab. |

## T-HC-13: Access Explorer Shows Who Can See What, and Why

**Purpose:** Confirm an admin can see a person's access and its sources, a permission set's access, who has access to a kind of record or field, and BarnCRM's permission sets, that each table downloads, and that nobody else sees it.
**Prerequisites:** admin and staff (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)); staff holds the **Team Member** role.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As the admin, open **Org Optimizer** and choose the **Access Explorer** tile. | **Access Explorer**, **Who can see or change what, and why. Every view only reads, except Change Field Access, which shows each change before it is made.**, a **Show** choice with **By Person or Permission Set** selected, **Look Up** set to **Person**, and **Choose a person or permission set to see their access.** |
| 2 | Type the first two letters of the staff user's name in **Person** and choose them. | **Access Comes From** lists their profile (**Profile**), then **Team Member (BarnCRM role)** (**Kind** **Permission Set Group**, **Includes** BarnCRM Staff and the other sets in the role). A **Kinds of Record** table follows, sorted by name, with **Read**, **Create**, **Edit**, **Delete**, **View All**, **Modify All** and **Granted By**. **Relationship** has **Read**, **Create**, **Edit** and **Delete** as **Yes**, and **Granted By** reads **Team Member (through BarnCRM Staff)**. |
| 3 | Choose **Relationship** in **Field Access For**. | A **Fields** table with **Field**, **Read**, **Edit** and **Granted By**, and no **API Name**. **Description** shows **Yes** for **Read** and **Edit**; **Relationship Number** (Name) shows **Always**. Turn on **Show technical names** at the top: **API Name** columns appear in the **Kinds of Record** and **Fields** tables and the **Field Access For** list adds API names in brackets. Turn it off again. |
| 4 | Type one letter in **Person**. | No search runs and nothing is listed until a second letter is typed. |
| 5 | Choose **By Kind of Record**, then **Relationship** in **Kind of Record**. | **Who Gives Access** lists profiles, then permission set groups, then permission sets, with **Kind**, the six permissions and **Active People**. **Team Member** is there with at least 1 active person, and **System Administrator** shows **View All** and **Modify All** (it gives Modify All Data). **People With Access** lists active people by name with **Granted By**. |
| 6 | Choose **Description** in **Field**. | **Who Gives Access** now shows **Read** and **Edit** only, and **People With Access** reloads. Choose **Relationship Number**: **Anyone who can read this kind of record can see this field. Salesforce does not let it be restricted.** and no tables. |
| 7 | In an org with more than 50 active people with access, click **Show More**. | The next 50 people are added below, in name order, with no one listed twice. **Show More** disappears after the last page. |
| 8 | Choose **By Person or Permission Set**, set **Look Up** to **Permission Set**, type `Staff` and choose **BarnCRM Staff** (**Permission Set**). | **Access Comes From** lists only **BarnCRM Staff**, and the table shows only what it gives: **Relationship** with **Granted By** **BarnCRM Staff**. |
| 9 | Search `Team` and choose **Team Member (BarnCRM role), Permission Set Group**. | **Access Comes From** shows **Team Member (BarnCRM role)** with **Includes** naming its sets, and **Relationship**'s **Granted By** reads **Team Member (through BarnCRM Staff)**. |
| 10 | Choose **BarnCRM Roles and Extra Permissions**. | The BarnCRM roles first, each named with **(BarnCRM role)** (such as **Team Member (BarnCRM role)**) and **Kind** **Permission Set Group**, then the BarnCRM permission sets, the extra permissions named with **(extra permission)** (such as **BarnCRM Bulk Update (extra permission)**) and **Kind** **Permission Set**, each with **Active People**. Below: **The Tab Access Check is scheduled hourly. Next run:** and a time, or, if it is not scheduled, a message pointing to Health Check. |
| 11 | Click **Download CSV** under any table. | A file named **Access_Explorer-** and today's date ending .csv downloads with the table's columns and rows, and **Downloaded {n} rows.** shows. |
| 12 | As staff (no Manage BarnCRM Settings), open **Org Optimizer**. | There is no **Access Explorer** tile or tab. |
| 13 | As the admin, open **BarnCRM Settings**, then the **Access** page, and click **Open Access Explorer**. | **Org Optimizer** opens on the **Access Explorer** section. |
| 14 | As an admin without View All Users (no BarnCRM Access Manager permission set), repeat step 5. | Above **People With Access**: **You may not see everyone: without View All Users, this list shows only the people Salesforce lets you see.** With View All Users the line is not shown. |

**Cleanup:** None. Access Explorer changes nothing.

## T-HC-14: Access Explorer Compares Two People and Reports Modify All

**Purpose:** Confirm an admin can compare two people or two permission sets, showing differences only by default, and can list who holds Modify All Data, View All Data and object-level Modify All and View All.
**Prerequisites:** admin and staff (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)); staff holds the **Team Member** role; the org has a System Administrator profile user.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As the admin, open **Org Optimizer**, choose **Access Explorer**, then **Compare Two**. | **Compare** set to **People**, two search boxes labeled **First** and **Second**, and **Choose two to compare.** |
| 2 | Choose the admin under **First** and the staff user under **Second**. | A **Similarity** percentage, **Differences Only** checked, and a **Kinds of Record** table whose **Difference** column reads, for example, **Only {admin name}: Edit, Delete.** Every row differs. A line says how many rows differ. |
| 3 | Clear **Differences Only**. | Rows both people give identically appear with a blank **Difference**. |
| 4 | Choose **Relationship** in **Compare Fields For**. | A **Fields** table, differences only, with **Read** and **Edit** for each side and **Difference**. |
| 5 | Set **Compare** to **Permission Sets**. Both choices clear. Type `Staff` under **First** and choose **BarnCRM Staff**, then type `Admin` under **Second** and choose **BarnCRM Admin**. | The tables show the two sets' differences, with the two set names as column headings. |
| 6 | Choose the same permission set on both sides. | **Similarity** reads 100% and the table says **No differences.** |
| 7 | Choose **Modify All Report**. | **Data-Wide Access** lists the System Administrator profile with **Modify All Data**, **View All Data** and **Author Apex** all **Yes**. A permission set that gives only Author Apex shows **Yes** under **Author Apex** and blank under the other two. **Kinds of Record** lists object-level Modify All and View All, with **Scope**, **Active People** and **In Groups**. |
| 8 | Click **Download CSV** under each table. | A file named **Access_Explorer-** and today's date ending .csv downloads, and **Downloaded {n} rows.** shows. |
| 9 | As staff, open **Org Optimizer**. | There is no **Access Explorer** tile, so neither view is reachable. |

**Cleanup:** None. Access Explorer changes nothing.

## T-HC-15: Weekly Admin Summary in the Digest

**Purpose:** Confirm a weekly digest carries the admin summary, sends nothing when there is nothing to report, and the setting turns the summary off.
**Prerequisites:** admin (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)); the error digest scheduled; email deliverability set to all email; an Error Log with no New entries since the last digest.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **BarnCRM Settings**, **Error Log**. Set **Digest frequency** to **Once a week**. | **Send weekly admin summary** is shown ticked with a **Default** badge. |
| 2 | In **Error Digest**, click **Send Now** in an org with no new entries, no failed jobs, no duplicates waiting, no limit at 80 percent and no Setup change kept since the last digest. | The panel says there was nothing new and no email goes out. |
| 3 | Make a Contact Import fail (load a file, then break the job) and, if the org has an active duplicate rule, save a duplicate Contact past the alert. Click **Send Now**. | An email arrives titled **BarnCRM: Weekly Admin Summary**. Under **Admin Summary** it lists **Failed BarnCRM jobs** with a link to each and **Duplicates waiting for review**. No record content is in it. |
| 4 | Add a New Error Log entry (for example by running a failing action), then **Send Now**. | The email is titled **BarnCRM: 1 new Error Log entries** and carries the error counts first, then the **Admin Summary**. |
| 5 | Untick **Send weekly admin summary**, save, and **Send Now** again after step 3's problems are still present. | No summary section is sent; with no new entries, no email. |
| 6 | Set **Digest frequency** back to **Every day** and **Send Now** with a New entry. | The email has the error counts only, with no **Admin Summary**. |
| 7 | Set **Digest frequency** to **Once a week** and tick **Send weekly admin summary**. In Setup, change the help text of any Contact field. Open **Org Optimizer**, **Setup Changes**, click **Copy New Changes Now**, wait a minute, then **Send Now** in **Error Digest**. | Under **Admin Summary**: **Setup changes since the last digest: {n} (see Org Optimizer, Setup Changes)**, counting your change (counted once, by when it was kept: a second **Send Now** after the next digest does not count it again). |

**Cleanup:** Restore **Digest frequency** and **Send weekly admin summary** to their earlier values, and change the help text from step 7 back.

## T-HC-16: Setup Changes Keeps Who Changed What

**Purpose:** Confirm an admin can copy the Setup Audit Trail into BarnCRM, find a change by its words, day and section, download it, and that nobody else sees it.
**Prerequisites:** admin (a System Administrator, so the trail can be read) and staff (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)). This script copies real Setup changes into **Setup Change** records; in a real-org sandbox that uses about 2 KB of data storage per change.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As the admin, open **Org Optimizer**. | **Overview** has a **Setup Changes** tile under **Check Your Setup**: **Who changed what in Setup, and when, kept beyond Salesforce's 180 days.** |
| 2 | Choose **Setup Changes** on an org where nothing has been copied yet. | **Nothing is kept yet. Press Copy New Changes Now to copy the last 180 days of Setup changes.** and **The nightly copy is not scheduled.** (or **This shows changes up to the last copy. New changes are copied every night at 1:30 and kept for 730 days. To see changes made since then, press Copy New Changes Now.** if Health Check already scheduled it). The empty state reads **No kept change matches these filters.** |
| 3 | Click **Copy New Changes Now**. | **The copy has started and runs in the background.** The status line reads **A copy is running.** |
| 4 | Wait a minute or two (longer in a busy org) and click **Refresh**. | **Kept: {n} changes, from {day} to {day}.**, the status line says the copy runs every night at 1:30 and keeps changes for 730 days, and the table lists changes newest first with **Changed At**, **Changed By**, **Logged In As**, **Section** and **What Changed**. |
| 5 | In Setup, change the help text of any Contact field. Back on **Setup Changes**, click **Copy New Changes Now**, wait, then **Refresh**. | Your change is at the top, with your name in **Changed By** and the field in **What Changed**. |
| 6 | Type the field's label in **Search** and click **Search**. | Only changes that mention it. Add a second word that is not in any of them: **No kept change matches these filters.** |
| 7 | Clear **Search**. Choose a **Section**, and set **From** to today. | Only today's changes in that section. Set **To** to yesterday and click **Search**: **From is after To.** and nothing is asked of the server. |
| 8 | Clear the filters and click **Download CSV**. | A file named **Setup_Changes-** and today's date ending .csv downloads, and **Saved {n} changes as CSV.** shows. Its header row is **Changed At**, **Changed By**, **Logged In As**, **Section**, **Action**, **What Changed**. |
| 9 | In **BarnCRM Settings**, **Org Optimizer**, find **Days to keep setup changes**. Set it to `100` and click **Save**. | Shows **730** before you change it. Nothing is saved; the value is marked as outside its range (180 to 3,650). |
| 10 | Open **Org Optimizer**, **Health Check**, and run it. | If the nightly jobs finding lists jobs, **Setup Changes Copy** is one of them unless step 3 already scheduled it. |
| 11 | As staff (no Manage BarnCRM Settings), open **Org Optimizer**. | There is no **Setup Changes** tile or tab. |

**Cleanup:** Change the help text from step 5 back. The copied **Setup Change** records stay until the nightly copy deletes them after **Days to keep setup changes**; nobody edits or deletes them by hand.

## T-HC-17: AI-Readiness Export Downloads a Pack With Sensitive Fields Handled

**Purpose:** Confirm an admin can download the AI-Readiness Export pack, that flagged fields are left out, masked or kept as chosen, and that nobody else sees it. Nothing is sent to an AI service.
**Prerequisites:** admin and staff (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)); sample data loaded; a zip tool and a text editor.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As the admin, open **Org Optimizer** and choose **AI-Readiness Export**. | **AI-Readiness Export**, the intro saying BarnCRM never sends anything to an AI service, a **Kinds of Record** picker with **Account**, **Contact** and Core's data objects under **Selected**, **Include Records** and **Include Data Quality Checks** ticked, **Include Fill Rates** unticked, **Review Sensitive Fields** enabled and **Download Pack** disabled, with a line saying to review first. |
| 2 | Move everything except **Contact** out of **Selected**, tick **Include Fill Rates**, then click **Review Sensitive Fields**. | **Sensitive Fields** lists Contact fields with **Object**, **Field**, **API Name**, **Why It Is Flagged** and **In the Pack**, among them **Email** (Email address), **Mobile Phone** (Phone number), **Birthdate** (Birth date), **Last Name** (Name) and **Mailing Street** (Address). Every **In the Pack** reads **Leave Out**. **Download Pack** is enabled. |
| 3 | Set **Last Name** to **Mask** and **Email** to **Keep**, then click **Download Pack**. | Progress lines (**Counting fill rates for Contact.**, **Reading records of Contact: {n} so far.**, **Writing the pack.**), then a file named **AI_Readiness_Export-** and today's date ending .zip downloads and **Downloaded the pack: 1 kinds of record and {n} records.** shows. |
| 4 | Unzip it. | `README.md`, `schema.json`, `data-dictionary.csv` and `data/Contact.csv`. |
| 5 | Open `data/Contact.csv`. | The header row starts **Id**, uses API names, and has **Email** and **LastName** but no **Birthdate**, **MobilePhone** or **MailingStreet**. **LastName** values read `masked-` and ten letters and digits; two contacts with the same last name have the same code. **Email** holds real addresses. **AccountId** holds Account Ids. |
| 6 | Open `schema.json`. | `"format": "barncrm-ai-readiness-export"`, one object **Contact** with `"recordFile": "data/Contact.csv"`; the **Email** field has `"sensitive": "email"`, `"handling": "keep"` and a `fillRate` between 0 and 1; **Birthdate** has `"handling": "leaveOut"` and `"inRecordFile": false`; `relationships` includes `AccountId` to **Account**; `dataQuality.checks` lists the Data Quality checks with counts. |
| 7 | Open `README.md`. | Headings **What Is in This Pack**, **Kinds of Record**, **How Records Connect**, **Privacy**, **Data Quality Notes** and **How to Use It With an AI Tool**. **Privacy** names Contact.Birthdate among the left-out fields, Contact.LastName as masked and Contact.Email as kept. |
| 8 | Download again with the same choices and compare `LastName` codes. | The codes differ from the first pack (each pack has its own key). |
| 9 | Untick **Include Records**, click **Download Pack**. | The zip has no `data` folder, and `schema.json` has `"recordFile": null` for Contact. |
| 10 | Add **Account** to **Selected**. | The sensitive field list goes and **Download Pack** is disabled until **Review Sensitive Fields** is pressed again. |
| 11 | As staff (no Manage BarnCRM Settings), open **Org Optimizer**. | There is no **AI-Readiness Export** tile or tab. |

**Cleanup:** Delete the downloaded zip files.

## T-HC-18: Data Dictionary Labels Are Trimmed

**Purpose:** confirm object labels in the Data Dictionary carry no leading or trailing spaces.
**Prerequisites:** the admin user.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open **Org Optimizer**, **Data Dictionary**, and open the kinds of record list. | Each label starts at the left edge, with no gap before it. |
| 2 | Choose **Account** and download the CSV. | The object label column reads `Account` with no space before or after it. |

**Cleanup:** Delete the downloaded file.

## T-HC-19: Field Access Manager Gives and Removes Field Access, With a Preview and Undo

**Purpose:** Confirm an admin can give and remove Read and Edit on fields and kinds of record across permission sets the organization made, that every change is previewed with the access it needs added, that it can be undone, and that profiles, groups, packaged sets and other people are kept out.
**Prerequisites:** admin and staff (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)); sample data loaded. In Setup, create two permission sets with no license: **FAM Test One** and **FAM Test Two**, neither giving anything.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | As the admin, open **Org Optimizer**, choose **Access Explorer**, then **Change Field Access** under **Show**. | **Permission Sets** with a search box, **Kind of Record**, an empty **Changes** list and **Recent Changes**. **Preview** is disabled. |
| 2 | Type `FAM` in **Permission Sets** and choose both test sets. | Both appear under the search box. Type `System Administrator` and `Team Member`: neither a profile nor a permission set group is offered. Type `BarnCRM`, then `Volunteers`: no permission set BarnCRM ships is offered, packaged or not. |
| 3 | Choose **Contact** in **Kind of Record**. | A **Fields** table with **Field**, **API Name** and **Now**, reading **Read: 0 of 2. Edit: 0 of 2.** Required and system fields (Last Name, Created By) are not listed. A formula field says **Read only**. |
| 4 | Tick **Email** and **Phone**, choose **Read and Edit** in **Access for the Ticked Fields**, press **Add to Changes**. | **Changes** lists **Contact**, **Email**, **Read and Edit** and **Contact**, **Phone**, **Read and Edit**. |
| 5 | Choose **Relationship**, set **Access to the Kind of Record** to **Read**, press **Add to Changes**. | **Changes** adds **Relationship**, **(The kind of record)**, **Read**. |
| 6 | Press **Preview**. | **Preview** lists 8 rows, each with **Permission Set**, **Kind of Record**, **Field**, **Now**, **After** and **Why**: per set, Contact **No Access** to **Read** with **Needed for field access**, Email and Phone **No Access** to **Read and Edit** with **Asked**, and Relationship **No Access** to **Read** with **Asked**. The line above says 8 rows change on 2 permission sets and 0 are already right. |
| 7 | Press **Apply Changes**, then **Apply** in the confirmation. | "Changed 8 rows; 0 refused. You can undo this change under Recent Changes." **Recent Changes** lists it first with **Rows Changed** 8, **Refused** 0, **Status** **Complete** and an **Undo Until** date. |
| 8 | Choose **By Person or Permission Set**, look up **Permission Set** `FAM Test One`. | **Contact** and **Relationship** have **Read**; under **Field Access For** **Contact**, **Email** and **Phone** have **Read** and **Edit**. |
| 9 | Back on **Change Field Access**, with both sets chosen, choose **Contact**, set **Access to the Kind of Record** to **No Access**, press **Add to Changes**, then **Preview**. | Per set: **Contact** **Read** to **No Access** with **Asked**, and **Email** and **Phone** **Read and Edit** to **No Access** with **Removed with the kind of record**. |
| 10 | Press **Clear** under **Changes**. In **Recent Changes**, press **Undo** on the change from step 7 and confirm. | **Status** reads **Undone**. Look up `FAM Test One` again: it gives nothing. |
| 11 | In Setup, give **FAM Test One** Read on Account, then add **Account**, **Read** here and press **Preview** but not **Apply**. In Setup, remove that Read again, then press **Apply Changes**. | Nothing is saved, and the page asks you to preview again, because the number of rows to change is different. |
| 12 | Open **Org Optimizer**, **Setup Changes**, and press **Copy New Changes Now**. | Rows for **FAM Test One** and **FAM Test Two** field and object permission changes are listed. |
| 13 | As staff (no Manage BarnCRM Settings), open **Org Optimizer**. | There is no **Access Explorer** tile, so **Change Field Access** is not reachable. |
| 14 | As an admin who holds BarnCRM Admin but not Manage Profiles and Permission Sets, open **Change Field Access**. | **You need the Manage Profiles and Permission Sets permission to change field access.** and nothing to choose. |

**Cleanup:** In Setup, delete **FAM Test One** and **FAM Test Two**.

## T-HC-20: Where Used Lists the BarnCRM Setup That Uses a Field

**Purpose:** Confirm Where Used finds saved queries, Super Transformer step lists, import mappings and rollups that name a field, links each, offers the whole object, and ends in a Retire a Field checklist that never deletes anything. Setup detail: [Where Used and Retire a Field](../admin-guide/where-used.md).
**Prerequisites:** admin (see [Test users](before-you-test.md#test-users)); the Rollup Builder module installed for step 6; a test custom field on Contact, such as **Test Retire** (`Test_Retire__c`, text), created in Setup.
**Smoke:** no

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In **Find**, build a query on **Contact** with **Test Retire** as a column and a filter **Test Retire is not blank**; save it as **Retire Check**. | The query saves. |
| 2 | In **Import**, start a people import with a file that has a column named **Retire**, map it to the person's **Test Retire** and save the mapping as **Retire Mapping**. | The mapping saves. |
| 3 | Open **Org Optimizer**, choose **Data Dictionary**, build it for **Contact**, open the action menu on the **Test Retire** row and choose **Where Used**. | A window titled **Where Used: Test Retire (Contact)** with a note that flows, Apex code, page layouts, reports and the rest are not checked, and an **Open in Setup** link. It lists **Retire Check** under **Saved Find Queries** (Named in: Columns, Filter) and **Retire Mapping** under **Import Mappings** (Named in: Column "Retire"), each with an "If deleted" line. |
| 4 | Click **Retire Check**. | Find opens in a new tab with the query loaded. |
| 5 | Look at **Retire a Field**. | Five steps: edit the records above, check Salesforce's own uses (Open in Setup), back up the values (Open in Find), hide the field, delete it in Setup (Open in Setup). Ticking two shows **2 of 5 steps done**. Nothing is deleted. |
| 6 | In **Rollup Builder**, make a rollup that counts Contacts with **Test Retire** not blank on their organization; then repeat step 3. | The rollup is listed under **Rollups** (Named in: Filter on counted records). |
| 7 | Click **Show Uses of the Whole Kind of Record**. | The title becomes **Where Used: Contact**, the list shows setup that works on Contact (Named in: Works on this kind of record), and **Retire a Field** is gone. Click **Show Uses of This Field** to go back. |
| 8 | Repeat step 3 for the standard field **Last Name**. | The last step says the field can't be deleted and to keep it hidden. |
| 9 | Choose **Field Use**, count **Contact**, and choose **Where Used** on a row; then open a Contact, click **Inspect This Record** and click the **Where Used** button beside **Test Retire**. | The same window opens from both places. |
| 10 | With Programs installed, give a program an eligibility rule on **Referral Source**, then run **Where Used** for the Enrollment field **Referral Source**. | The program is listed under **Programs** (Named in: Eligibility Rules) with an "If deleted" line and a link that opens the program. |
| 11 | With Logic Models installed, give an indicator a computed source counted by a date field, then run **Where Used** for that date field. | The indicator is listed under **Indicators** (Named in: Source Definition) with a link that opens its logic model. |

**Cleanup:** Delete **Retire Check**, **Retire Mapping**, the rollup and the **Test Retire** field.

## T-HC-21: Households On While NPSP Households Are in Use

**Purpose:** Confirm Health Check reports both packages making households and links the adoption panel.
**Prerequisites:** admin; an org with NPSP installed (Account Model **Household Account**) and Households turned on before NPSP's model was set that way (for example turn Households on with Account Model **One-to-One**, then set it back to **Household Account**).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On **Org Optimizer**, **Health Check**, click **Run Again**. | **NPSP and BarnCRM Both Make Households**, **Warning**, saying Households is on while NPSP households are in use, with the button **Open NPSP Household Adoption**. |
| 2 | Click **Open NPSP Household Adoption**. | **BarnCRM Settings** opens on **General**, with the **Adopt NPSP Households** panel. |
| 3 | Adopt every NPSP household and set NPSP's **Account Model** to **One-to-One**, then **Run Again**. | The finding is gone. |
| 4 | In an org without NPSP, **Run Again**. | No such finding. |

**Cleanup:** Put NPSP's Account Model back to what you want.

## T-HC-22: Report Subscriptions

**Purpose:** Confirm BarnCRM's reports are listed, a subscription is created for the person through the org connection, a second save updates it, and a missing connection is explained.
**Prerequisites:** admin with **BarnCRM Metadata Admin**, Customize Application, Modify Metadata and Salesforce's Subscribe to Reports; Giving installed for its reports. For step 1 the org connection is not set up; from step 2 it is set up and connected (see [Creating a New Field From an Import](../admin-guide/import-new-fields.md)). Fewer than 7 report subscriptions of your own.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | On **Org Optimizer**, open **Report Subscriptions**. | The intro, a notice that the org connection is needed and the connection panel. Every report in a BarnCRM folder (for example **Errors by Day**, **LYBUNT Donors**) is listed with its folder and description, each a link that opens the report in a new tab. No **Subscribe** button. |
| 2 | Set up the connection from the panel, leave and reopen the section. | Each report has **Subscribe**. |
| 3 | On **New Versus Retained Donors** choose **Subscribe**, then **Weekly**, **Monday**, **7:00 AM**, and **Save**. | **Saving your subscription.**, then a green **Subscribed. Salesforce will email you New Versus Retained Donors on the schedule you chose.** |
| 4 | Open the report and choose **Subscribe**. | Salesforce shows your subscription: weekly on Monday at 7:00 AM, sent to you. |
| 5 | Back on the section, subscribe to the same report **Monthly** on day **1**. | **Subscribed.** again. The report's **Subscribe** shows monthly on the 1st, and there is still one subscription to it, not two. |
| 6 | With 7 subscriptions of your own, subscribe to another report. | A red notice: you already have 7 report subscriptions, the most Salesforce allows. |

**Cleanup:** Remove the test subscriptions from each report's **Subscribe** button.

## T-HC-23: Skew Findings and a Report That Stops Early

**Purpose:** Confirm Health Check reports a fund with very many gifts, and that a run near Salesforce's limits reports the checks it left instead of failing.
**Prerequisites:** admin with BarnCRM Admin; Giving installed; a test fund you may change. Workbench or the Developer Console to set a field the page does not show.

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Set the test fund's **Gift Count** to `10001` (Workbench or the Developer Console), then run Health Check. | **Funds or Appeals With Very Many Gifts**, information only, links the test fund and advises loading its gifts serially or in smaller batches. |
| 2 | Set **Gift Count** back to what it was and **Run Again**. | The finding is gone. |
| 3 | In an org where one user with a role owns more than 10,000 households or gifts (a large sandbox), run Health Check. | **One User Owns Too Many Accounts** (or **Gifts**), a warning, names that user. |
| 4 | In a large sandbox where Health Check takes many seconds, run it. | Either every finding, or the findings that ran plus **Not Checked, Run Again** naming the checks it left. The page never shows a load failure. |
| 5 | When step 4 shows **Not Checked, Run Again**, click **Run Remaining Checks** (next to **Run Again**). | Only the checks it named run. Their findings join the same report, the **Not Checked** warning is gone (or names only what is still left, with the button again), and the org shape card is unchanged. With every check run, the button is not shown. |
| 6 | In an org where every check runs (a small one), run Health Check. | No **Run Remaining Checks** button. |

**Cleanup:** Put the test fund's Gift Count back.

## T-HC-24: Repeated Errors Are Counted on One Entry

**Purpose:** Confirm the same failure repeated within an hour is one Error Log entry with a count and the first records named, and that a reviewed entry is not added to.
**Prerequisites:** admin; the Developer Console (in an org where BarnCRM is installed from a package, put the namespace prefix before `ErrorLogger`).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In **Debug**, **Open Execute Anonymous Window**, run `List<String> m = new List<String>(); List<Id> ids = new List<Id>(); for (User u : [SELECT Id FROM User LIMIT 20]) { m.add('QA repeat test'); ids.add(u.Id); } ErrorLogger.logMessages(m, ids, 'QA', 'Warning');` | It runs without an error. |
| 2 | Open the **Error Log** tab, **New Errors**. | One **QA** entry, not one per user. Opened, **Occurrences** reads the number of users found (up to 20), **Record Reference** names the first user and **Other Records** lists up to ten more. |
| 3 | Mark the entry **Acknowledged** and run step 1 again. | A second **QA** entry with its own count; the acknowledged one keeps its count. |

**Cleanup:** Delete the two test entries.

## T-HC-25: Different Failures With One Message Are Separate Entries

**Purpose:** Confirm two failures that show the same message but differ in exception type or code line get their own Error Log entries, while a repeat of one is still counted (D-208).
**Prerequisites:** admin; the Developer Console (in an org where BarnCRM is installed from a package, put the namespace prefix before `ErrorLogger`).

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | In **Execute Anonymous**, run `for (Integer i = 0; i < 3; i++) { try { Integer x = null; x++; } catch (Exception e) { ErrorLogger.logWithMessage(e, 'QA', 'QA same message'); } } try { insert new Account(); } catch (Exception e) { ErrorLogger.logWithMessage(e, 'QA', 'QA same message'); }` | It runs without an error. |
| 2 | Open the **Error Log** tab, **New Errors**. | Two **QA** entries, both reading `QA same message`: one with **Occurrences** 3 (its Technical Detail names a NullPointerException) and one with 1 (a DmlException). |

**Cleanup:** Delete the two test entries.
