# BarnCRM Testing Guide

Applies to: BarnCRM main f69141c1c (landing batch L, with batch K). Pre-release: no package version exists yet; this tracks the newest code on main.

Manual, step-by-step test scripts for checking a build in a scratch org or sandbox, feature by
feature. Written for a tester: the project owner or a pilot org admin. Start with
[Before you test](before-you-test.md).

> **Not for production orgs:** BarnCRM is in pilot. We do not recommend installing pilot or testing versions in a production Salesforce org. Test in a sandbox, a free Developer Edition org or a scratch org.

**Report a bug or give feedback** through GitHub: open
<https://github.com/Nonprofit-Collaborative/BarnCRM/issues/new/choose> and choose the bug report
template. [SUPPORT.md](../../SUPPORT.md) says what to include, and
[Report a failure](before-you-test.md#report-a-failure) says how to fill it in from a test
script. Never include donor or other personal data. Report a security problem privately, as
[SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) describes.

## How This Relates to the Automated Tests

Two layers check every build.

| Layer | What it is | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Apex test gate | `scripts/org/run-org-tests.sh <alias>` deploys the checked-out commit and runs every Apex test class in it (about 3,500 tests), then posts the result to GitHub as the commit status the merge rule requires. See [CI](../contributor-guide/ci.md), "The org test gate". | Logic: triggers, services, rollups, validation, sharing, permission checks in code. |
| Manual scripts (this guide) | A person follows numbered steps in a real org and compares what they see with the expected result. | What the gate cannot see: that pages, tabs, buttons and labels are there and say the right thing, that setup flows work end to end, that a user without a permission set is refused in the UI, that undo really puts data back as a person sees it, and that pages work with a keyboard and on a phone. |

Run the gate first. A build that fails it is not ready for manual testing. Scale and the full
mobile audit have their own plan: [Scale and mobile test plan](../contributor-guide/scale-and-mobile-test-plan.md).

## Script IDs

Each script is `T-<AREA>-NN`, numbered from 01 within its page, for example `T-GIFT-04`. An ID
is never reused for a different test. A script added later takes the next free number on its
page, even if that puts it out of reading order.

## Smoke List (Every Build, About One Hour)

Run these in this order on one Person Accounts org set up as in
[Before you test](before-you-test.md), all modules deployed and sample data loaded. Some later
scripts use what an earlier one created, so keep the order.

**Core-only real-org sandbox (for example `mwdbdevsb`).** Run items 1 to 15 only; skip 16 to 25
(Giving, Volunteers and Rollup Builder are not deployed). Set up as in
[Core-only real-org sandbox](before-you-test.md#core-only-real-org-sandbox): Core deployed
with `--core-only`, no sample data, work in the **BarnCRM** app, hold **BarnCRM Admin**,
and create the **Zztest** fixture first. Read Garcia as Zztest in every script. Extra
permissions: **BarnCRM Duplicate Review** for item 13 and **BarnCRM Erase People** for item
15 only, removed straight after. Item 15 erases a fixture contact you created (Luis Zztest),
never a real person. For item 3, give and remove the role on the other tester, never a real staff member. Item 1 (T-SA-01) is Skipped if setup was finished already, and its
steps 1 and 2 need a staff user, so run steps 3 to 8 only.
| # | Script | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [T-SA-01](setup-assistant.md#t-sa-01-first-run-setup-every-feature-on), steps 3 to 8 | First-run setup, Nonprofit Edition. Run it on the test org the first time you open it, instead of a separate org; ignore the sentence about modules in step 3. |
| 2 | [T-SET-01](settings-and-module-manager.md) | Settings console opens |
| 3 | [T-SET-04](settings-and-module-manager.md) | Give and remove a role on the Access page |
| 4 | [T-HH-01](people-and-households.md) | A new person gets a household |
| 5 | [T-HH-02](people-and-households.md) steps 1 to 3, then [T-HH-07](people-and-households.md) | Add Ben to the Testwell household (T-HH-07 needs him), then merge two households |
| 6 | [T-ADDR-01](addresses.md) | Add a seasonal address |
| 7 | [T-REL-01](relationships-and-affiliations.md) | Two-sided relationship |
| 8 | [T-IMP-01](imports.md) | Import a contact list |
| 9 | [T-IMP-03](imports.md) | Undo an import |
| 10 | [T-FIND-01](find.md) | Build and run a query |
| 11 | [T-BULK-01](bulk-update-and-delete.md) | Super Transformer run from Find |
| 12 | [T-BULK-02](bulk-update-and-delete.md) | Undo a Super Transformer run |
| 13 | [T-DUP-01](duplicates.md) | Duplicate scan |
| 14 | [T-HC-03](org-optimizer-and-health-check.md) | Health Check report (skipped install steps add findings: see the script) |
| 15 | [T-ERASE-02](erase-a-person.md) | Erase a person (in a real-org sandbox: only Luis Zztest, with **BarnCRM Erase People** given for this script only) |
| 16 | [T-GIFT-01](giving-gifts-funds-batches.md) | Default fund (later Giving scripts need it) |
| 17 | [T-GIFT-04](giving-gifts-funds-batches.md) | Quick Gift Entry |
| 18 | [T-GIFT-08](giving-gifts-funds-batches.md) | Gift batch: enter, balance, post |
| 19 | [T-COM-01](giving-commitments.md) | Pledge and schedule |
| 20 | [T-CRED-01](giving-soft-credits-tributes-matching.md) | Household soft credits |
| 21 | [T-RCPT-01](giving-receipts-and-acknowledgments.md), [T-RCPT-02](giving-receipts-and-acknowledgments.md) | Receipt settings, then issue a receipt |
| 22 | [T-REF-01](giving-refunds.md) | Refund a gift |
| 23 | [T-GRD-01](giving-rollups-and-dashboards.md) | Recalculate giving totals |
| 24 | [T-VOL-02](volunteers.md), [T-VOL-03](volunteers.md) | Create a shift, sign people up |
| 25 | [T-RB-01](rollup-builder.md) | Rollup Builder opens, nightly run scheduled |

T-ERASE-02 and T-REF-01 change sample data that other scripts name; if you go on to the full
list in the same org, run them last or refresh the org first.

## Full Regression List

Every script on every page above, before a release or after a change that touches many areas.
Run Core pages first (People and households through Erase a person), then Giving, then Mirror,
Volunteers, Programs, Logic Models, Funders and Rollup Builder, then Accessibility and mobile. Within a page, run in ID order.

Run it on the Person Accounts shape, then repeat the Core pages and the Giving pages on the
platform-only shape (Mirror needs Opportunity and Campaign, so skip it there). Scripts that need
their own org (for example T-SA-01 and T-SA-02, which need an org never opened) say so in their
prerequisites.

Two scripts change org state that other scripts are hard to run after: closing an accounting
period (T-GIFT-10) blocks removing sample data, and erasing a person (T-ERASE pages) cannot be
undone. Each page notes this where it applies.

## Keeping This Guide Current

The guide tracks main. A pull request that adds or changes a feature visible in the UI updates
the matching page here in the same pull request, as it does the
[feature catalog](../barncrm-features.md). A new feature area gets a new page and a row in the
table above.
