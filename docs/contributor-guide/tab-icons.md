# Tab Icons

Every BarnCRM tab, Core and module, carries a motif whose number matches the icon Salesforce documents for it (D-144, UX-F3). A tab's icon comes from the `CustomN` number only; the name after the colon is a note, so a guessed name hides a wrong icon (`Custom25` is the alarm clock, never an envelope). Use the Metadata API's documented `CustomTab.motif` list, Custom1 to Custom100.

Rules:

- Write the motif as `CustomN: Name`, with the name the documented list gives for N.
- No two Core tabs share a number, and no two tabs in one package share a number, so each tab is recognizable in the navigation, the page header and a console tab. Salesforce documents only 100 motifs and BarnCRM had used all of them by the combined build (2026-11-11), so a module tab may reuse a number another module uses, never a Core tab's (D-193).
- A new tab takes a number no Core tab and no tab in its own package uses; prefer one no tab uses. Add it to the table below; `scripts/ci/tests/test_core_navigation.py` fails if it is invalid or reused against these rules.
- Add the tab to the icon registry, `packages/core/main/default/lwc/barnIcons/barnIcons.js`, keyed by the tab's API name, in the same PR. The same test fails when a tab is missing from the registry or listed with another number.
- Navigation icon equals tab icon: a link or tile that opens a tab takes its icon from `iconFor('<tab API name>')` (c/barnIcons). See the [Visual Standard](ux-kit.md#visual-standard).
- A card's header icon is its own page's or object's tab icon (`custom:customN` with that tab's number), never another tab's. See Card Icons below.

## Card Icons

A `lightning-card` header shows the icon of the page or object the card belongs to, so a card reads as part of its tab (vis-core-4, extends D-144). Rules:

- A card on a tab's own page, or about one object, uses that tab's `custom:customN`, with N the tab's motif number.
- A card never uses another tab's number: a borrowed motif tells people the card is about something else.
- Card headers use `standard:*` or `custom:*` icons only; a `utility:*` glyph renders small and grey beside colored icon tiles.
- A card with no tab of its own keeps a `standard:*` icon. The people panels (Household, Members, Relationships, Affiliations, Addresses) each have a tab, so they use its icon; the rows inside them use `lightning-avatar` with initials or a `standard:*` object icon.

Every card with a `custom:*` icon is listed here. `scripts/ci/tests/test_core_navigation.py` fails when a card uses a `custom:*` icon that is not listed, when the listed tab's motif number differs, when the component names neither the icon nor `iconFor('<Tab>')` (c/barnIcons), or when a card header uses a `utility:*` icon.
