# Migration kit (unlocked to managed)

The kit in `scripts/migration/` moves a production pilot from the unlocked packages to the
managed packages (C-31, ADR-0088 `0088-unlocked-to-managed-migration-kit.md`). The
administrator's procedure is [Moving a pilot to the managed packages](../admin-guide/moving-to-managed-packages.md);
this page is how the kit works and how to keep it right as the packages grow.

Nothing in the kit is packaged, and it never creates a package version.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `scripts/migration/build_mapping.py` | Reads `packages/*/main/default/objects` and writes the mapping (JSON) |
| `scripts/migration/overrides.json` | The only hand-kept part: objects skipped, upsert keys, related standard records |
| `scripts/migration/migrate.py` | `check`, `export`, `reimport`, `verify` against an org, through `sf` |
| `scripts/migration/tests/` | Unit tests; no org needed (`python3 -m unittest discover scripts/migration/tests`) |

## The mapping

`build_mapping.py --packages core,rollups,giving,mirror,mirrorgiving --output mapping.json` collects, for each
listed package:

- every custom object, with its fields, except formula fields, auto-number fields, and objects
  that hold no records (custom metadata types, platform events);
- the package's fields on Account and Contact, and their record types;
- a field added to another package's object (Mirror for Giving's fields on `Gift__c` and `Appeal__c`)
  joins that object's entry.

Each object records its kind (`custom`, `standard`, or `setting` for a hierarchy custom
setting), its fields, its lookups and their targets, whether its Name is typed or
auto-numbered, and its upsert key if `overrides.json` names one. Objects are ordered so that a
master-detail parent and, where there is no cycle, a lookup parent come first. Names are held
without a namespace; `migrate.py --namespace` prefixes every name that ends in `__c` at run
time, which is safe because the mapping holds only packaged custom names.

## overrides.json

- `skip`: objects not copied, each with the reason printed by `build_mapping.py`. Today the
  import staging rows and the import undo journal (meaningless once every Id changes).
- `upsert_keys`: objects the managed install fills itself, with the unique field to match
  on, so reimport updates the shipped row instead of adding a second: automation switches and
  rollup definitions (both created by the post-install scripts), and the receipt number
  sequence (its counter must carry over exactly).
- `related`: standard records hung on packaged records that uninstall deletes with them: tasks
  and events (by `WhatId`) and file links (by `LinkedEntityId`).

A new object or field needs no change here. A new object that a post-install script seeds (a
`*PostInstall` class) needs an `upsert_keys` row naming a unique external Id field, or reimport
adds a second copy of each seeded record. Nothing detects a missing row automatically: a review
of any post-install change checks it. `build_mapping.py` refuses a key that is not a unique
external Id.

## How reimport works

1. **Standard records first.** Account and Contact keep their Ids through an uninstall, so
   their packaged fields are updated in place. Record types are matched by developer name.
2. **Custom records, in mapping order, through the sObject Collections API**, 200 a call,
   `allOrNone` false. Results come back in request order, so result *n* is the new Id of
   source row *n*. Each pair is appended to `id-map.csv` in the export folder as it arrives.
3. **Lookups and Id-holding text.** A lookup whose target is already loaded is translated on
   the way in. One whose target is not yet loaded (a cycle, or a self lookup) is left blank and
   filled in the second pass. Any Text or Long Text value that equals a source Id (15 or 18
   characters) of a copied record is translated the same way: ADR-0014 stores Giving record Ids
   as text in Core.
4. **Second pass.** One update per record that had anything deferred.
5. **Related records**: tasks and events are inserted with their `WhatId` translated; file
   links are recreated when the file still exists, and listed in `refused.csv` when it does
   not.

A rerun reads `id-map.csv` and skips every source row already mapped, so a stopped run is
resumed by running it again.

Protected hierarchy custom settings are exported to `settings.csv` (organization level
values only) when the source org lets the API read them, and never reimported: a managed
package's protected setting is not writable from outside the package.

## Household adoption and conversion journals

`Account.Household_Model__c` (MIG-02b) is a packaged Account field, so it carries over in
place like any other. The `Household_Adoption__c` journal (NPSP adoption, ADR-0155, and the
Nonprofit Cloud household conversion, ADR-0217 `0217-npc-household-conversion.md`) is copied
as an ordinary object, but the Household Member Ids a conversion writes inside its
`Previous_Values__c` JSON are not whole-value Ids, so they are not translated. After a move,
an undo of a conversion run made before it restores each Account but finds none of its
members, and reports the household Not Restored because it still has members. Tell the
administrator to finish or undo any conversion before the move.

## verify

`verify` exports the target org with the same mapping, translates every Id through
`id-map.csv`, and compares field by field with the original export. Differences expected from
the platform (auto-number names, audit fields without `--keep-audit-fields`, formula values) are
not compared, because they are not in the mapping.

## What an org rehearsal must confirm

The kit's unit tests run against a fake `sf`. The first rehearsal, on a full copy sandbox of a
real pilot, must confirm:

- that uninstalling Core succeeds while Accounts still carry the Household and Organization
  record types, and what those Accounts are left with;
- whether a protected custom setting of an unlocked package can be read through the API (if
  not, `settings.csv` is empty and the administrator's screenshots are the record);
- that Giving's receipt lock and posting lock accept inserted receipted and posted gifts for a
  user holding both override permissions, and that the receipt number sequence carries on
  from the migrated counter;
- that files linked to packaged records survive the uninstall (the kit relinks them if so);
- that the pause stops household creation and naming during reimport, so Accounts are not
  given a second household;
- the time and API calls per 10,000 records.

Record the results in the iteration's release notes and correct this page and the admin guide
page.
