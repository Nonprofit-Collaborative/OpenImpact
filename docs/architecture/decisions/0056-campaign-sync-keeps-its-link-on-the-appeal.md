# ADR-0056: Campaign sync keeps its link on the appeal, writes with the saver's access, and is off until switched on

**Status:** Accepted (builder decision)
**Date:** 2026-09-24 (amended 2026-09-25 after review)
**Amends:** ADR-0029, which says Core is the only package with a post-install script
**Source:** builder decision under plan Section 9.3, feature X-02 (plan Section 4.12, "Campaign
sync: `Appeal__c` to Campaign one-way, so Campaign Members and marketing tools work"); refines
ADR-0017 and ADR-0021 for Connect; canonical model Section 29B

## Context

Plan Section 4.12 gives X-02 one sentence. It leaves open where the link between an appeal and
its Campaign lives, when the copy runs, whose access it runs with, what it does with a Campaign
that already exists, and whether it is on at install.

Four constraints narrow the answer.

1. **Campaign may be named only in Connect, and only dynamically** (plan Section 4.2,
   ADR-0009, ADR-0013). Giving cannot hold the link: `check-standard-objects.sh` fails a Giving
   file that names Campaign at all. A lookup to Campaign anywhere, including in Connect, is a
   compile-time reference, and Connect must still install on an org without Campaign.
2. **Opportunity mirror (X-01) will need it.** Plan Section 4.12 has the mirrored Opportunity
   take its "Campaign from appeal link". Whatever holds the link is X-01's input, so it has to
   be cheap to read from a gift and, for X-01's "Opportunity is source" direction, cheap to
   read backwards from a Campaign.
3. **Every DML that user input can reach runs in user mode** (plan Section 9.3). An appeal's
   name and description are typed by staff and would be copied onto the Campaign.
4. **Creating a Campaign in Salesforce needs more than an object permission.** The user must
   also carry the Marketing User box on their user record. Most fundraising staff do not.

## Decision

1. **The link is one attribute on Appeal, shipped by Connect.** `Appeal__c.Campaign_Id__c`,
   Text(18), unique, external ID, lives in `packages/connect/main/default/objects/Appeal__c`.
   A dependent package adding a field to its base package's object is the ordinary 2GP
   extension pattern. It holds the identifier as text for constraint 1. It is unique so a
   Campaign mirrors at most one appeal, and an external ID so X-01 finds an appeal from a
   Campaign by an indexed read. There is no link object. X-02 needs one link per appeal and
   nothing else, and a generic mirror link object designed now would guess at X-01's and
   X-07's needs. Those features may still add one; this attribute does not stop them.
2. **The copy runs before the appeal is saved.** A `Campaign_Sync` automation on `Appeal__c`
   (Automation Registry, order 50, after the hierarchy check) creates or updates the Campaign
   in the before-insert and before-update context, then writes the new identifier onto the
   appeal being saved. The link is therefore stored in the same save, and a failed link write
   can never leave an orphan Campaign that the next save duplicates. Values are compared
   first, so a Campaign that already matches is not written.
3. **The Campaign is written in user mode.** Campaign is not package-owned data, so ADR-0021's
   writer pattern does not apply, and constraint 3 settles it. The consequence of constraint 4
   is accepted rather than worked around: a person who cannot create Campaigns still saves
   the appeal, the appeal keeps no Campaign ID, and one Warning goes to the Error Log for the
   save. The Campaign sync page counts the appeals without a Campaign and offers **Sync all
   appeals**, a background batch run as the administrator who starts it (Manage Nonprofit
   Settings, one at a time), which catches them up.
4. **A failure never refuses the appeal.** Every Campaign write uses partial success. Each
   refusal is logged with the appeal and the platform's message. The appeal saves.
5. **Off at install, through a Connect settings object.** Plan Section 4.1 makes a minor
   feature a hierarchy custom setting flag, and ADR-0017 gives each package its own settings
   object, so Connect gains `Connect_Settings__c` with `Campaign_Sync_Enabled__c`, default
   off, shown in the Giving section of Nonprofit Settings. It is off because an org with
   Campaigns of its own (every NPSP org) must decide before Open Impact adds more. The
   automation switch is kept as well, because every packaged automation has one (ADR-0040):
   the setting says whether the feature is wanted, and the switch pauses it. The setting is
   the authoritative one: Sync all appeals follows it alone, and the automation switch only
   pauses the copy made on save.
6. **Connect gains a post-install script.** `ConnectPostInstall` does one thing: it calls
   `AutomationControl.ensureDefaultsDuringInstall`, as `GivingPostInstall` does, so the
   `Campaign_Sync` automation switch row (`Automation_Setting__c`) exists from install.
   Without it, a fresh Connect install would show Health Check a missing switch. It does not
   create or touch `Connect_Settings__c`: no org default record is needed, because the
   field's default of false already reads as off (decision 5). It is also where X-01 and X-07
   will materialize their own switches. This amends ADR-0029, whose context says Core is the
   only package with a post-install script: Giving has had one since ADR-0029 itself, and
   Connect now has one too. Each script must be named as its package's `postInstallScript`
   when package versions are created.
7. **Nothing the org had is deleted, and a stale link is reported, not replaced.** Deleting
   an appeal leaves its Campaign. The one deletion is Sync all appeals undoing its own work:
   the batch stores new links with partial success, so one appeal it cannot save (a rule on
   Appeal, or no edit access) never rolls back its chunk, and the Campaign it created for that
   appeal a moment earlier is deleted in user mode, so the next run does not make a second one.
   A Campaign it cannot delete is named in a Warning for the administrator to remove. A linked
   Campaign that is gone or invisible to the saver is logged as "deleted or not visible to
   you".
   A missing Campaign and an invisible one look the same in user mode, and a replacement made
   for an invisible Campaign would be a duplicate. Clearing Campaign ID makes a new Campaign;
   typing an existing Campaign's identifier links to it, and the appeal's values then
   overwrite that Campaign's copied fields.
8. **Bulk-safe by construction.** Every Warning a call produces is collected and written in
   one statement, whatever the number of refused appeals, so a 200-appeal save refused by a
   Campaign validation rule costs one log write, not 200. The save path checks the
   transaction's remaining queries, DML statements and DML rows before copying; a save too
   large to copy (thousands of appeals in one Apex transaction) is left uncopied with one
   Warning per transaction, for Sync all appeals. A saver without Campaign access is logged
   only when creating appeals, and once per transaction, so edits do not flood the log.
9. **What is copied** is canonical model R-CS2: name, description, dates, goal to Expected
   Revenue, cost to Actual Cost, active, and the parent appeal's Campaign as Parent Campaign.
   Campaign Type and Status are left to the org's defaults. The Campaign's own Opportunity
   totals are the platform's.

## Alternatives considered

- **A lookup from Appeal to Campaign, or from Campaign to Appeal.** Rejected: either is a
  compile-time reference, so Connect would not install on a Platform-only org.
- **A generic Mirror Link object for X-01, X-02 and X-07.** Rejected for now: one more object
  and one more query for a one-to-one link. X-01 mirrors up to a million gifts and may want
  the link on Gift for the same reasons this ADR puts it on Appeal.
- **System mode Campaign writes, so any appeal saver gets a Campaign.** Rejected: an elevated
  write of typed text onto a standard object the package does not own. It is the case plan
  Section 9.3 and security review exist for.
- **After-save copy with a second appeal update.** Rejected: two saves, recursion to guard
  against, and a failed second save leaves a Campaign that the next save would create again.
- **Copy asynchronously (queueable).** Rejected: the person adding Campaign Members right
  after saving an appeal would find no Campaign, and the job would still run as the same user
  with the same access.
- **A nightly scheduled catch-up.** Not built: plan Section 9.3 says do not invent features.
  If orgs find the manual Sync all appeals button a burden, a nightly job on the Nightly Jobs
  page (ADR-0038) can be added later without a model change.
- **On at install.** Rejected for the NPSP reason in decision 5.
- **Filter Sync all appeals to the appeals the runner can edit (`UserRecordAccess`) instead of
  deleting a Campaign it could not link.** Not chosen: it covers missing edit access but not a
  rule on Appeal refusing the save, so the delete is needed anyway, and Appeal is shared Read/Write
  at install.

## Consequences

- Connect ships its first field on another package's object, its first settings object, its
  first registry row and its first post-install script. `ConnectPostInstall` must be named as
  the Connect package's `postInstallScript` when package versions are created, as Core's and
  Giving's must. ADR-0029 carries an "Amended by" line pointing here.
- Fundraising staff without the Marketing User box get no Campaign from their own saves. The
  admin guide tells the administrator to either give those users Campaign access and Marketing
  User in Setup, or run Sync all appeals after a batch of new appeals.
- A Campaign field edited by hand in one of the copied attributes is overwritten when its
  appeal next changes. The admin guide says so.
- A child appeal saved before its parent has a Campaign gets no Parent Campaign until it is
  saved again or Sync all appeals runs. The batch runs a second pass over child appeals so a
  single run leaves the hierarchy complete.
- X-01 reads `Appeal__c.Campaign_Id__c` to set an Opportunity's Campaign, and reads it
  backwards through the external ID for "Opportunity is source". Both need no change here.
