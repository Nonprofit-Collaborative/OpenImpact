## Reviewer agent checklist (Section 9.4)

- [ ] Does it meet the definition of done (Section 7.4)?
- [ ] Could Maria do this without Setup and without the docs? If not, why not, and is that recorded?
- [ ] Are the numbers right? (Rollups recalculated in tests after every path: insert, update, delete, undelete, reparent, merge.)
- [ ] Does it work on the Platform-only org shape?
- [ ] Does it degrade gracefully when a module is off or a standard object is absent?
- [ ] Is anything overwritten on upgrade that an admin might have changed?
- [ ] Is the label language a nonprofit's language?
