# BarnCRM Scholarships and Outbound Grants

## Purpose

Grantmaking for organizations that give money (D-122, plan Section 5.11, ADR-0204
`0204-scholarships-outbound-grants-module.md`): programs and cycles, applications through BarnCRM
Forms, rubric reviews with reviewer panels, awards and letters, disbursements recorded only
(BarnCRM moves no money), conditions, recipient reports and the applicant portal template.

## First ships in

Release **1.12** (SG-01 to SG-06, SG-08, SG-09, PB-06), with SG-10 from release 1.10.

## Depends on

Forms and Portal Builder are used when installed, through Core's `FormAttachmentExtension` and
